Information received since the Committee met in June indicates that the economy 
is evolving broadly in line wit h expectations.  The labor market has continued to 
strengthen, with the unemployment rate staying low and payrolls  expanding strongly.  
Real GDP growth appears to ha ve rebounded in the second quarter  by even more than 
previously expected.  The staff continues to project above-trend GDP growth through 
2019 and high levels of resource util ization over the medium te rm.  The 12-month 
changes in headline and core PCE  prices are estimated to have b een 2.3 and 1.9 percent, 
respectively, in June.  For this y ear as a whole, as well as for 2019 and 2020, the staff 
projects both headline and core PC E inflation close to 2 percen t.  
There are two key questions that the Committee is facing at thi s meeting:  First, 
whether the available informati on warrants raising the target range for the federal funds 
rate; second, whether the fed eral funds rate path suggested by recent policy 
communications remains appropriate , given the current economic outlook and associated 
risks.  The three alternative draft statements have been prepar ed with these questions in 
mind. 
Alternative B’s characterization of the labor market is the sam e as that in the June 
statement; the expansion in econom ic activity is described as s trong rather t han solid.  
Alternative B notes  that both overall and core measures of 12-m onth inflation remain 
near 2 percent.  It maintains the current target range for the federal funds rate and 
reiterates the Committee’s expect ation that further gradual inc reases will be consistent 
with sustained economic growt h, a strong labor market, and infl ation near 2 percent over 
the medium term. 
Alternative C takes the view that a steep er policy rate path th an signaled in the 
Committee’s recent communications  will likely be appropriate.  It registers some concern 
about potential overheating by noting that “the Committee is closely monitoring the 
economic and financial implicati ons of high levels of resource utilization.”  
Consequently, Alternative C not onl y raises the target range bu t also omits the indication 
that further rate increases are expected to be “gradual.” 
Alternative A is motivated by the view that longer-run inflation expectations may 
currently be too low for the Comm ittee to achieve its symmetric  objective of 2 percent

inflation.  Alternative A articu lates an outlook in which infla tion exceeds 2 percent for a 
time conditioned on “the current stance of monetary policy” rat her than further gradual 
increases in the federal funds r ate.  Accordingly, this alternative maintains the current 
target range for the federal funds rate. 
With regard to the specifics of the language in Alternatives A,  B, and C: 
 The three alternatives are simila r in their assessments of the incoming data.  All three 
alternatives note that grow th of household spending and busines s fixed investment 
has been strong.  Alternatives B and C state that overall and core inflation “remain 
near 2 percent,” while Alternative A observes that they “have moved close to 
2 percent.”  The alternatives diffe r slightly in characterizing  inflation expectations: 
o Alternatives B and C describe i ndicators of longer-term inflati on expectations 
as “little changed, on balance” over the intermeeting period. 
o Alternative A states that thes e indicators “remain low.” 
 With respect to the outlook for economic activity and inflation , the associated risks, 
and the monetary policy pat h upon which the outlook is conditio ned: 
o Alternative B projects “sustain ed expansion of economic activit y, strong labor 
market conditions, and inflation ne ar the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent 
objective over the medium term,”  and notes that ri sks to this o utlook are 
“roughly balanced.”  Alternative B conditions these outcomes on  “further 
gradual increases” in t he federal funds rate. 
o Motivated by the risks posed by ove rly tight labor market condi tions, 
Alternative C signals that a st eeper trajectory of the federal funds rate “will be 
warranted to achieve a sustainab le expansion of economic activi ty, maintain 
strong labor market conditions, and keep inflation near the Com mittee’s 
symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.”  While con tinuing to 
describe the risks to the ou tlook as roughly bala nced, Alternative C notes that 
“the Committee is closely monito ring the economic and financial implications 
of high levels of res ource utilization.” 
o Alternative A projects that inflation will “move modestly above  2 percent for 
a time and then run near the Commi ttee’s symmetric 2 percent ob jective” 
given “the current stance of monetary policy.”  Alternative A states that this

inflation path “should help ensur e that longer-term inflation e xpectations are 
consistent with the Committee’ s symmetric objective of 2 percen t inflation.” 
 With respect to the c urrent policy decision: 
o Alternatives A and B leave the target range for the federal fun ds rate 
unchanged at 1¾ to 2 percent.  Both A lternatives characterize t he stance of 
monetary policy as remaining accommodative and supporting stron g labor 
market conditions and inflation at 2 percent.  
o Alternative C raises the target range for the federal funds rat e to 2 to 
2¼ percent.  Alternative C also c haracterizes the stance of mon etary policy  
as remaining accommodative, but it removes the reference that the 
accommodative stance supports strong labor market conditions and a 
sustained return to 2 percent infl ation.  Removal of this refer ence would 
convey a judgement that maintaining an accommodative stance cou ld soon  
no longer be appropriate.

JUNE 2018 FOMC STATEMENT 
1. Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in May 
indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and  that economic 
activity has been ris ing at a solid rate.  Job gains have been strong, on average, in 
recent months, and the unemployment rate has declined.  Recent data suggest that 
growth of household spending has picked up, while business fixe d investment has 
continued to grow strongly.  On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and 
inflation for items other than food and energy have moved close  to 2 percent.  
Indicators of longer-term inflati on expectations a re little changed, on balance. 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that fur ther gradual 
increases in the target range f or the federal funds rate will be consistent with 
sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market c onditions, and 
inflation near the Committee’ s symmetric 2 percent objective ov er the medium 
term.  Risks to the economic  outlook appear roughly balanced. 
3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and in flation, the 
Committee decided to rai se the target range for the federal fun ds rate to 1-3/4 to 
2 percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative , thereby 
supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained retur n to 2 percent 
inflation. 
4. In determining the timing and size  of future adjustments to the  target range for the 
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expe cted economic 
conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 
2 percent inflation objective.  This assessment will take into account a wide range 
of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of 
inflation pressures and inflati on expectations, and readings on  financial and 
international developments.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 Available data indicate that the  labor market has continued to strengthen. 
o Payroll gains averaged 211,000 i n the three months ending in June, well above 
the pace that the staff estimates is consistent with no change in resource 
utilization. 
o The unemployment rate has stayed low.  The uptick to 4.0 percen t in June was 
largely due to a rise in t he participation rate. 
o The unemployment rate is currently below all participants’ esti mates of the 
longer-run normal rate of unempl oyment in the June Summary of E conomic 
Projections. 
o Average hourly earnings rose 2¾ percent over the year ending in  June.  This 
reading is only modestly hi gher than a year earlier. 
 Inflation remains close to the  Committee’s sy mmetric 2 percent goal. 
o The 12-month change in core PCE  prices is estimated to have bee n 1.9 percent 
in June.  The estimate for total PCE inflation is 2.3 percent o ver the same time 
period. 
o The staff projects that core PCE inflation will remain close to  2 percent 
through 2020.  Total PCE inflati on on a 12-month basis is projected to slow to 
just below 2 percent by the end of  2018 as energy prices are ex pected to 
continue to level off; thereafte r, total PCE inflation is projected to run a bit 
below core inflation, but still close to 2 percent, as energy p rices are projected 
to gradually decline. 
o Both market- and survey-based ind icators of longer-term inflation 
expectations have moved little, on b alance, since the June FOMC  meeting; 
both continue to be consistent wit h the view that these expecta tions remain 
stable. 
 The staff estimates that output  currently stands about 2 percen t above its potential 
level and that the output gap will continue to widen, reaching more than 3 percent in 
2019.  In this projection, real GDP  growth increases to almost 3 percent this year and 
then gradually slows to 1¾ percent in 2020.

 Foreign real GDP growth appears t o have moderated from its fast pace earlier this 
year.  However, the staff projec ts that foreign real GDP will expand at a solid pace 
going forward. 
 Risks to the outlook appear roughly balanced.  Although trade p olicy developments 
could pose downside risks for economic activity, it is also possible that fiscal policy 
will provide a str onger-than-expected boost to GDP growth. 
Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers may see economic conditions as continuing to evolv e in line with their 
expectations.  With Alternative B, policymakers would continue to signal that the 
economic outlook calls for further  gradual increases in the tar get range for the federal 
funds rate, but, in light of the two increases earlier this year, not for an adjustment to 
the stance of monetary polic y at the July/August meeting. 
o Policymakers may judge that gradual removal of monetary policy accommodation may continue to be a ppropriate in order to balanc e the risk of 
overly tight resource utilization a gainst the risk of inflation persistently falling 
below 2 percent. 
 Policymakers may see recent inflation developments as confirming the view that the 
idiosyncratic factors that held dow n inflation last year were transitory.  They may 
expect that inflation will continue to run close to the Committ ee’s symmetric 
2 percent inflation goal as furth er gradual tightening of monet ary policy takes place. 
o Policymakers may also view longer-term inflation expectations t o be 
reasonably well anchored and consistent with the Committee’s in flation 
objective. 
 Policymakers may still see it appropriate to state that “the st ance of monetary policy 
remains accommodative.”  The current target range for the federal funds rate remains 
below the 2.8 to 3 percent central  tendency for the longer-run level of the federal 
funds rate in the June Summary of  Economic Projections.  However, as was noted in 
the minutes of the June meeting, policymakers may believe it de sirable to modify 
soon the “remains accommodative” language.  As background, the box titled “The 
Removal of the ‘Remains Accommo dative’ Language in 2005” recoun ts the FOMC’s 
discussions in the mid-2000s that led to the removal of such la nguage. 
 A statement along the lines of A lternative B seems unlikely to generate appreciable 
changes in asset prices.  As discussed in the “Monetary Policy Expectations and

July 26, 2018The Removal of the “Remains Accommodative” Language in 2005 
A key question the Committee is likely to face before too long is when it should stop 
characterizing the stance of monetary policy as remaining accommodative. The previous 
time the Committee faced this decision was in late 2005. Based on the FOMC meeting 
transcripts, this box reviews the Committee’s discussions over that period that led to the 
removal of the “remains accommodative” language from the statement at the December 
2005 meeting. 
Between June 2004 and November 2005, the Committee raised the federal funds rate target 
from 1 percent to 4 percent, and each rate increase was accompanied by an FOMC statement 
that referred to monetary policy as accommodative. During most of this period, 
postmeeting statements noted that “The Committee believes that, even after this action, 
the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative.” 1 
Early in the tightening cycle, there was broad consensus among Committee participants that 
monetary policy was accommodative. This view reflected in part the fact that, at the time, 
the real federal funds rate was below most estimates of the neutral real federal funds rate, 
such as some of those shown in figure 1. As the Committee steadily raised the policy rate in 
2005, FOMC participants had more frequent discussions about the appropriateness of 
continuing to characterize the stance of monetary policy as accommodative. These 
discussions often cited estimates of the neutral rate of interest and its potential drivers— 
such as labor productivity growth, investment, and international economic and financial 
factors. Inflation developments during 2005 also generated discussions of how estimates of 
expected inflation might alter the Committee’s understanding of the current real federal 
funds rate and therefore the perceived real rate gap. 
1 This sentence was dropped at the September 2005 meeting, but the September and 
November FOMC statements continued to refer to “monetary policy accommodation.” The 
tightening cycle ended in June 2006, with the federal funds rate target reaching 5¼ percent, after 
17 consecutive 25 basis point increases.

At the November 2005 meeting, the staff reported that, during that year, indicators of the 
economy, shown in table 1, had generally moved toward full resource utilization and that the 
real interest rate had reached estimates of its neutral level. At that meeting, participants 
began to discuss more extensively when to stop characterizing the stance of monetary 
policy as accommodative in the postmeeting statement. 
The discussions at the November and December meetings revealed two broad views among 
FOMC participants with regard to the influence of estimates of the neutral rate of interest on 
the statement’s language. Some participants stated that the real rate was either close to or 
had reached its neutral level, and judged it appropriate for the Committee to acknowledge 
this development by removing the accommodative language. Staff estimates of the neutral 
rate reported in the December 2005 Bluebook, which ranged from 2.1 to 3.5 percent at that 
time, suggested that the real federal funds rate had reached the lower end of that range. 
Other participants were concerned that uncertainties surrounding estimates of the neutral 
rate were sufficiently large that an implicit reference to a neutral level—implied by 
describing monetary policy as accommodative—was no longer helpful. 
At the December meeting, all FOMC members agreed to adjust the language in the 
statement. However, there was concern that removing the characterization of monetary 
policy as accommodative while also indicating the potential for further rate increases might 
be interpreted by market participants as an indication that the Committee viewed a steeper 
path of policy as appropriate. Several participants noted their uncertainty about how 
investors would revise their expectations for future monetary policy following the release of 
the December statement. 
For much of 2005, the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers showed that only a few survey 
respondents expected a change in the “accommodative” language in the statement. 
However, as the Committee’s discussions about this topic intensified and information was 
disseminated to the public in the November FOMC meeting minutes, expectations for a 
change to the statement firmed up.2 As shown in figure 2, in the December Survey of 
Primary Dealers, more than three quarters of the respondents expected the FOMC to 
“change the characterization of the stance of monetary policy as accommodative,” up from 
just under onequarter in the prior survey. 
2 In particular, the November minutes stated that “Several aspects of the statement language 
would have to be changed before long” and that “risks of going too far with the tightening process 
could also eventually emerge.” Investors apparently interpreted these statements as a sign that the 
FOMC was closer to the end of its current interest rate tightening cycle than they had expected. 
Following the release, the expected path for the funds rate through the middle of 2006 was 
unchanged, but policy expectations beyond that horizon fell somewhat.

As shown in  table 2, changes in asset prices upon the release of the December  FOMC

Monetary Policy Expectations and Uncertainty 
Measures of monetary policy expectations were generally little changed over the 
intermeeting period. Market participants remain confident that the Committee 
will keep the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at the 
July/August FOMC meeting and announce a 25basis point increase in the target 
range at the September meeting. The expected path of the federal funds rate 
over the medium term was also little changed. 
As shown in figure 1, a straight read of quotes on federal funds futures contracts 
suggests that the probability attached to a rate hike at the upcoming FOMC 
meeting remains close to zero. The probability of the next rate hike coming at 
the September meeting is about 85 percent, about 15 percentage points higher 
than immediately before the June FOMC meeting.  On average, respondents to 
the Desk’s July/August surveys also assigned virtually no odds to a rate hike at 
the upcoming meeting and similarly high odds to a September rate increase. 
Figure 2 show s the probability distribution for the level of the federal funds rate 
at the end of 2018, based on options quotes and assuming zero term premiums. 
The distribution suggests that investors place the highest odds on two more 
25basis point hikes in the target range for the federal funds rate by the end of 
the year. Figure 3 shows the corresponding average probability distribution 
implied by the Desk’s July/August surveys; it suggests that respondents attach 
more equal odds to either one or two more hikes. 
Looking further ahead, figure 4 shows the expected path of the federal funds 
rate through the end of 2019, derived from quotes on federal funds futures 
contracts, assuming zero term premiums and no changes between FOMC 
meetings. The path has risen a touch on net over the intermeeting period and 
suggests that investors expect a total of three hikes between now and the end of 
2019. It also suggests that investors continue to attach higher odds to rate hikes 
occurring at meetings accompanied by the release of updates to the 
Committee’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) than at meetings without 
an SEP update. This pattern is little changed from prior to the June FOMC 
meeting (the dotted lines), when the Chairman announced that a press 
conference will be held after every FOMC meeting beginning in 2019. 
Figure 5 shows various measures of the expected federal funds rate over a longer 
horizon. A straight read of the market based path derived from OIS quotes (the 
black line) suggests that investors do not expect any further increases in the 
federal funds rate beyond the end of 2019. Adjusting for term premiums using 
the staff’s term structure model (the light blue line) suggests that investors 
expect a faster pace of tightening, with the federal funds rate reaching 3 percent 
by the end of 2019. The model based path is similar to the Committee’s June 
median SEP projections and to the modal path reported by the median

respondent to the Desk’s latest surveys. That said, the survey implied modal 
path continues to lie noticeably above the survey implied mean path (the golden 
squares).1 Apparently, respondents continue to perceive risks to the economic 
outlook as skewed to the downside.2 The median respondent continued to 
attach about 20 percent probability to a return to the effective lower bound at 
some point over the next three years, unchanged from the previous surveys. 
The July/August Desk surveys asked respondents for their estimates of the 
current and future levels of the neutral real federal funds rate. The median 
estimate of the current neutral rate (not shown) was 0.50 percent, 
0.25 percentage point higher than in January 2018, when this question was last 
asked. Median estimates for the end of 2018, 2019, and 2020 were also a touch 
higher, at 0.53, 0.79, and 1.00 percent, respectively. As in the January surveys, 
respondents held diverse views; for example, estimates of the current neutral 
rate ranged between 0.50 and 3.00 percent. 
The Desk’s latest surveys also asked respondents for their projections for the 
most likely spread between the interest on excess reserves (IOER) rate and the 
effective federal funds rate (EFFR), conditional on a range of possible levels of 
reserve balances. Figure 6 shows that respondents expect a lower IOER–EFFR 
spread for a given level of reserve balances than in the May surveys, when this 
question was last asked. In the most recent surveys, the median projected 
spread falls to zero when reserve balances reach a level between $1,250 and 
$1,000 billion, which according to the Tealbook  baseline projection will be the 
case in late 2019 or early 2020 (see the “Balance Sheet and Income Projections” 
section of the Tealbook).3 The median respondent’s modal projection for the 
IOER EFFR spread over time (not shown) reaches zero in the second half of 2019. 
In a new question in the July/August surveys, respondents were also asked to 
project the level of the spread between the top of the target range for the 
federal funds rate and the IOER rate; the median of respondents’ modal 
expectations (not shown) was for the spread to be unchanged from the current 
level of 5 basis points at the end of 2018, but to widen to 10 basis points by the 
middle of 2019. No respondent had a modal expectation for the EFFR to lie 
above the top of the target range. 
1 The mean path is constructed from respondents’ probability distributions for the federal 
funds rate under certain assumptions. 
2 The staff term structure model may not adequately capture such a feature because it 
assumes that mean and modal short rate paths approximately coincide when the short rate is 
sufficiently far away from the effective lower bound. 
3 Respondents were asked to rate the importance of various factors in influencing the 
IOER EFFR spread over the remainder of 2018 and during 2019, on a scale from 1 through 5. 
The factors that received the highest median ratings were “change in the level of reserve 
balances” and “Treasury securities supply dynamics” (with average ratings of 3.4 and 4.1, 
respectively, for the remainder of 2018, and 4.3 and 3.9 for 2019).

Uncertainty” box, financial marke t quotes indicate that investo rs regard the odds of a 
rate hike at the upcoming meeti ng as negligible; the next rate hike is viewed as very 
likely to occur in September.  The assessment of respondents to  the Desk’s latest 
surveys of primary dealers and mar ket participants is similar. 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 Policymakers may judge that the la bor market is operating appre ciably beyond full 
employment and that economic ac tivity—which is expanding at a f aster-than-
sustainable rate—will conti nue to be spurred by expansionary fi scal policy.   
o The unemployment rate remains below each FOMC participant’s est imate of 
its longer-run normal level and is  projected to decline further .  Other 
indicators also point to an already-tight labor market; these include a near-
record-high job opening s rate, continued re ports of firms havin g difficulty 
hiring workers, and low levels of i nitial claims for unemployme nt insurance. 
 Policymakers may judge that the economy is strengthening more t han previously 
expected.  Payroll gains conti nue to surprise on the upside, an d even after accounting 
for factors that are expecte d to be transitory, the rebound of real GDP growth in the 
second quarter appears to have been strong.  These developments  may suggest that 
the neutral federal funds rat e is higher, and m onetary policy m ore accommodative, 
than previously estimated. 
 Policymakers may judge that unwanted upward pressure on inflati on is likely to 
emerge amid a prolonged period of significant labor market tigh tness. 
 Despite seven increases in the target range for the federal fun ds rate between 
December 2015 and June 2018 and a net appreciation of the dollar, financial 
conditions have, by some measures, eased on balance since Decem ber 2015.  On net, 
broad equity price indexes have  increased more than 35 percent and spreads of 
investment and speculative grade corporate bonds over equivalen t maturity Treasury 
securities remain around 60 and 270 basis points below their re spective values in 
December 2015, when the target range was first raised above its  effective lower 
bound.1  The narrowing of spreads on high-yield bonds has occurred eve n as the use

of leverage by speculative grade and unrated firms has increase d over the past several 
years. 
Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers may judge that a fa ster removal of policy accommod ation is necessary 
in the near term to avoid signi ficant overheati ng and a subsequent need to tighten 
policy abruptly. 
o Policymakers may be concerned that ongoing above-trend economic  growth 
and an already-strong labor market that continues to tighten co uld soon result 
in more notable upward pressure on inflation. 
o They may also judge that a steeper  trajectory of rate hikes is needed to prevent 
the unemployment rate from dec lining significantly further belo w its normal 
longer-run value; such a further  decline could make it increasi ngly 
challenging to engineer a soft landing as inflation picks up. 
o Additionally, amid elevated asset  valuations and high levels of  debt at risky 
firms, policymakers may see the need for a somewhat faster pace  of rate 
increases to avoid a significant  buildup of financial imbalance s.  
 For the above reasons, policymak ers may opt to increase the tar get range for the 
federal funds rate to 2 to 2¼ per cent at this meeting and to om it statement language 
that describes the future pace  of tightening as gradual. 
o In addition, while policymakers may still wish to characterize the stance of 
monetary policy as remaining accommodative, they may prefer not to describe 
the new level of the target range as “supporting strong labor m arket conditions 
and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.”  By removing th is description, 
policymakers may convey a judgement that maintaining an accommo dative 
stance could soon no longe r be appropriate. 
o Moreover, policymakers may wish t o signal that the Committee no w judges 
that a steeper path for the feder al funds rate—steeper than sug gested by the 
Committee’s previous communications—“will be warranted to achieve a sustainable expansion of economic activity, maintain strong labor market 
rating BBB.  The spread of specula tive grade corporate bonds is  derived from the subset of speculative 
grade corporate bonds that incl udes all securities in the five- year high-yield category.

conditions, and keep inflation near t he Committee’s symmetric 2 percent 
objective over the medium term.” 
 Policymakers may also wish to communicate in paragraph 2 that “the Committee is 
closely monitoring the economic a nd financial implications of h igh levels of resource 
utilization,” signaling concern a bout the risks associated with overheating, including 
the possibility that a prolonge d period of high resource utiliz ation might cause a 
significant buildup of financial imbalances. 
 Adopting Alternative C likely woul d surprise market participants considerably given 
the readings from financial ma rket quotes and the Desk’s latest  surveys, described 
above.  Market participants would read such a statement, if iss ued at the July/August 
meeting when no rate hike is expe cted, as indicating that the C ommittee intends to 
raise the federal funds rate mo re rapidly than previously expected.  Medium- and 
longer-term real interest rates could rise, as could the exchan ge value of the dollar; 
equity prices and inflation compensation could fall. 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 Policymakers may judge that, whi le inflation has moved close to  2 percent recently, it 
remains to be seen whether this  development will be sustained o r whether inflation 
will again drift lower.  On a 12-month basis, core PCE inflatio n is estimated to have 
been 1.9 percent in June.  The 12-month trimmed mean PCE inflation rate from the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 1.8 percent over th e 12 months ending in May, 
not much higher than in May 2017 when this measure stood at 1.7  percent. 
 One factor that could prevent inflation from returning to 2 percent on a sustained basis is low expected inflation.  Readings on market-based meas ures of inflation 
compensation remain substantially b elow where they were before the middle of 2014, 
and some survey-based measures of  longer-term inf lation expecta tions are still low by 
historical standards.  
 Moreover, the labor market may have room to strengthen further before reaching 
maximum employment.  While job g ains have been solid, wage grow th has not 
picked up much.  For prime-age wo rkers, both the labor force pa rticipation rate and 
the employment-to-population ratio have been rising, but they remain below their pre-recession levels and are low in c omparison to the experiences of other advanced 
economies, suggesting scope for f urther improvement along these margins.

Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers may be concerned that, because inflation has run p ersistently below 
2 percent in recent years, longer- term inflation expectations may be too low or are at 
risk of becoming too low; policymakers also may be concerned th at inflation 
expectations could drift down further if the Committee continues to tighten monetary 
policy without clear evidence that inflation will remain near 2  percent on a sustained 
basis. 
o Against that background, policymak ers may favor Alternative A in order to 
underscore the Committee’s comm itment to its inflation objectiv e and to 
ensure that longer-term inflati on expectations are  well anchore d at a level 
consistent with the Committee’ s 2 percent objec tive.  In additi on, 
policymakers may judge that the past decade’s experience of low inflation 
reduces the risk that longer-run inflation expectations will ri se significantly 
beyond 2 percent. 
o Consequently, policymakers may fa vor the addition of language i n paragraph 
3 to indicate that the Committee would welcome “a period of inf lation 
modestly above 2 percent” in order to “ensure  that longer-term inflation 
expectations are consistent wit h the Committee’s symmetric obje ctive of 
2 percent inflation.” 
 Policymakers may view the current state of the financial system  as sound and the 
potential for a buildup of risks t o financial stability as limi ted, or they may judge that 
interest rate policy is not an effective tool for addressing an y significant financial 
stability concerns that may emerge. 
 Despite the likely expansionary effects of recently enacted cha nges in fiscal policy, 
some other policies—particularl y the further escalation of trad e tensions—pose 
downside risks.  Policymakers ma y judge that their scope to rea ct to downside 
economic outcomes remains limited by the proximity of the feder al funds rate to the 
effective lower bound. 
 A statement along the lines of A lternative A would likely be re garded as an important 
change in the Committee’s polic y outlook and would reduce expectations of further 
rate hikes.  If the public saw thi s statement as primarily refl ecting policymakers’ 
resolve to push inflation above  2 percent for a time, then infl ation compensation 
could rise, real longer-term inte rest rates would probably fall somewhat, and equity 
prices might rise.  Lower real r ates and the prospect of higher inflation likely would

reflecting an unexpectedly downbeat  assessment of the economic outlook, equity

1.95 percent, effective June 14 August 2, 2018.  Setting the interest rate paid on 
required and excess reserve bala nces 5 basis points below the t op of the target 
range for the federal funds rate is intended to foster trading in the federal funds 
market at rates well within the FOMC's target range. 
 As part of its policy decision, the F ederal Open Market Committee voted to 
authorize and direct the Open Mar ket Desk at the Federal Reserv e Bank of New 
York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in th e System Open 
Market Account in accordance with  the following domestic policy  directive: 
“Effective June 14 August 2, 2018, the Federal Open Market Committee 
directs the Desk to undertake ope n market operations as necessa ry to

including overnight reverse repurchase opera tions (and reverse repurchase 
operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) a t an 
offering rate of 1.75 percent, in amounts limited only by the v alue of 
Treasury securities held  outright in the Sys tem Open Market Account that 
are available for such operati ons and by a per-counterparty lim it of 
$30 billion per day. 
The Committee directs the Des k to continue rolli ng over at auct ion the

elements of the associated incom e statement that are consistent  with the baseline 
economic outlook presented in Tealbook A.  Key features of thes e projections are 
described below.  
SOMA redemptions and reinvestments.   As reported in t he exhibit titled 
“Redemptions and Reinvestments of SOMA Principal Payments,” the  staff projects that 
the balance sheet normalization program initiated in October 20 17 will lead to the 
redemption of $229 billion of Treasury securities and about $15 2 billion of agency 
securities over 2018.  During t his same period, $197 billion of  principal from maturing 
Treasury securities and about  $65 billion of principal from age ncy securities will be 
reinvested.1  Under the staff’s current baseline forecast of rising longer- term interest 
rates, reinvestments of agency securities are projected to ceas e by October of this year, 
when the cap on monthly redemp tions rises to its $20 billion maximum.  However, the 
projections for agency securitie s are subject to considerable u ncertainty because 
unscheduled prepayments depend on several factors that are diff icult to predict, including 
the realized path of mortgage rates.2 
Evolution of the size of the balance sheet.   Based on the baseline economic 
outlook in the July Tealbook, the size of the balance sheet is projected to normalize in the 
second quarter of 2021, a month earlie r than in the June Tealbo ok.  (See the exhibit titled 
“Total Assets and Selected Balance Sheet Items” and the table that follows the exhibit).3 
1 Once the cap on monthly reductions in SOMA holdings of Treasur y securities has been fully 
phased in, reinvestments of principal from maturing Treasury se curities will primarily take place in the 
middle month of each quarter.   
2 If actual principal payments wer e to breach the $20 billion maximum cap before the size of the 
balance sheet is normalized, the n the Desk would reinvest in MBS the amount by which the principal 
payments received during any mont h exceeds the cap.  See the Ju ne FOMC memo titled “Operational 
Readiness for MBS Reinvestme nts” for further details. 
3 Many factors will influence th e size of the balance sheet upon  normalization, including banks’ 
post-crisis underlying demand for reserves.  Generally speaking , the size of the balance  sheet is considered 
to be normalized when the resumption of purchases of Treasury s ecurities is required to satisfy demand for 
reserve balances and accommodate the expansion of other key non-reserve liability items.

From the start of the balance sheet normalization program in Oc tober 2017 to its 
projected conclusion in 2021, the  Federal Reserve’s securities holdings are predicted to 
decline about $1.3 tri llion, with holdings of  Treasury and agen cy securities shrinking 
about $800 billion and $500 billion, respectively.  At the time the size of the balance 
sheet normalizes: 
 Reserve balances reach an assumed longer-run level of $500 bill ion.4 
 The SOMA portfolio is projec ted to be roughly $3 trillion, cons isting of about 
$1.7 trillion in Treasury secu rities and $1.3 tri llion in agenc y securities. 
 Total consolidated assets of the F ederal Reserve System are pro jected to be 
$3.1 trillion. 
Once these declines in asset holdings have taken place, the siz e of the balance 
sheet is projected to stand at roughly 13 percent of nominal GD P, compared with a peak 
of about 25 percent in 2014 and a pr e-crisis average of about 6  percent.  After the size of 
the balance sheet is normalized, SOMA holdings will rise, keepi ng pace with the 
increases in Federal Reserve lia bilities – includi ng Federal Reserve notes in circulation 
and the Treasury General Account  (TGA) – as well as Federal Res erve Bank capital.  As 
shares of nominal GDP, Federal Reserve assets and liabilities a re expected to edge down. 
Federal Reserve remittances.   Remittances to the Treasury are projected to 
decline to $59 billion this  year from $80 billion in 2017 (see the “Income Projections” 
exhibit).5  This decline primarily reflect s the realized and expected inc reases in the 
interest rate pai d on reserves in 2018.6  Total interest expense is pr ojected to rise to nearly 
4 Other noteworthy assumptions  about liability items underlying the projections are as follows:  
The Treasury General Account is a ssumed to increase in line wit h nominal GDP; Federal Reserve notes in 
circulation are assumed to incr ease at an average annual pace o f about 6 percent through 2020 and at the 
same pace as nominal GDP thereafter; the foreign repo pool and balances in the accounts of designated 
financial market utilities remain at their June 2018 levels of approximately $245 billion and $70 billion, 
respectively; and take-up at the overnight RRP facility is assu med to maintain its June 2018 value of about 
$10 billion until the level of reserve balances reaches $1 tril lion, at which point take-up declines to zero 
over the course of one year. 
5 This estimate includes two mandated transfers to the Treasury due to reductions to the statutory 
limit on aggregate Reserve Bank  surplus.  First , $2.5 billion w as transferred in February as a result of the 
Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018.  Second, $675 million was transf erred in June reflecting the amendment to 
The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection  Act of 2018. 
6 We continue to assume that the FOMC will set a 25  basis-point-wide target range for the federal 
funds rate throughout the projection period.  In contrast with the previous Tealbook and consistent with the 
June FOMC Implementation Note, we now assume that the interest rates paid on reserve balances will be

$50 billion this year, while inter est income from SOMA holdings  is expected to decline 
slightly, to $111 billion.  As the target range for the federal  funds rate moves up and the 
interest expense on reserve balances increases, remittances are expected to decline further 
and to bottom out at about $32 bi llion in 2020.  Thereafter, remittances increase as the 
Desk begins to add Treasury securi ties to the SOMA portfolio. 
The projected path for remittances over the next few years is s imilar to that in the 
June Tealbook.  As shown in the botto m left panel of the “Incom e Projections” exhibit, 
annual remittances average about 0.25 percent of nominal GDP ov er the projection 
period, slightly higher than t heir pre-crisis average. 
Unrealized gains or losses. The staff estimates that th e SOMA portfolio was in a 
net unrealized loss position of  nearly $20 billion at the end o f June.  With longer-term 
interest rates expected to rise f urther over the next several y ears, the unrealized loss 
position is expected to reach $265 billion in 2020:Q3.  Of this amount, about $105 billion is attributable to Treasury securities and $160 billion to agen cy MBS.  The unrealized 
loss position subsequently narrows, in large part because the v alue of securities acquired 
under the Federal Reserve’s larg e-scale asset purchase programs  returns to par as those 
securities approach maturit y.  Relative to the June Tealbook, t he net unrealized position 
over the projection period is little changed. 
Term premium effect.   As shown in the table “Pr ojections for the 10-Year 
Treasury Term Premium Effect,” SOMA securities held as a result  of the Federal 
Reserve’s asset purchase program s are currently estimated to be  reducing the term 
premium in the 10-year Treas ury yield by about 80 basis points, the same as in the 
previous Tealbook; this effect i s projected to fade gradually o ver time.
7 
SOMA characteristics.  As shown in the top panel of t he “Projections for the 
Characteristics of SOMA Treasury S ecurities Holdings” exhibit, the weighted-average 
duration of the SOMA Treasury port folio is currently about six years.  This measure is 
projected to increase over the co urse of balance sheet size normalization, as the pace of 
redemptions picks up and longer-dur ation securities become a la rger share of the 
set five basis points below the top of the target range for the  federal funds rate.  We continue to assume that 
the offering rate on overnight RRPs will be set to the bottom of the range. 
7 The estimated path of the term premium effect depends on the d ifference between the expected 
path of the Federal Reserve’s ba lance sheet over coming years a nd a benchmark counterfactual projection 
based on the configuration of the balance sheet that prevailed before the financial crisis of 2007 2008.

portfolio.  In terms of the composition of the portfolio, the s hare of agency MBS is 
expected to peak at 44 percent shortly before normalization, re flecting the faster pace of 
roll-offs of Treasury securities , and then to decline to less than 30 percent by 2025. 
After normalization of the si ze of the balance sheet in 2021, t he duration of the 
SOMA Treasury portfolio is project ed to decline as the Desk beg ins adding securities to 
the SOMA portfolio to keep pace with the expansion in non-reser ve liabilities.  The 
initial sharp decline in duration results from the staff’s assu mption that the Desk will 
purchase only Treasury bills until these securities account for  one-third of the Federal 
Reserve’s Treasury securities po rtfolio, close to their pre-cri sis share (currently the 
SOMA portfolio contains no Treas ury bills).  Thereafter, purcha ses of Treasury securities 
are assumed to be spread across the maturity spectrum (see the bottom panel of the 
exhibit titled “Projec tions for the Characteristics of SOMA Treasury Securities 
Holdings”).
