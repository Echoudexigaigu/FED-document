Information received since the Ju ly/August FOMC meeting indicat es that the 
economy is evolving broadly in lin e with expectations.  The lab or market has continued 
to strengthen, with the unemplo yment rate staying low and payro lls expanding strongly. 
Real GDP is estimated to have i ncreased at an annual rate of 3½ percent in the first half 
of the year.  The staff conti nues to project above-trend GDP gr owth through 2019 and 
high levels of resource utilizati on over the medium term.  Head line and core PCE prices 
are estimated to have increas ed 2.2 and 1.9 percent, respective ly, over the 12 months 
through August.  The staff forecas ts both headline and core PCE inflation to remain close 
to 2 percent through 2021.  
There are two key questions that the Committee is likely to fac e at this meeting:  
First, whether the available i nformation warrants raising the t arget range for the federal 
funds rate; second, whether the f ederal funds rate path and the  characterization of the 
stance of monetary policy suggested by recent policy communicat ions remain 
appropriate, given the current  economic outlook and associated risks.  The three 
alternative draft statements ha ve been prepared with these ques tions in mind. 
Under Alternative B, the Comm ittee would raise the target range for the federal 
funds rate and reiterate its expe ctation that further gradual i ncreases will be consistent 
with sustained economic growt h, a strong labor market, and infl ation near 2 percent over 
the medium term.  Reflecting th e increasing difficulty of making a definitive assessment 
of the stance of monetary policy, A lternative B removes the lan guage characterizing the 
stance of monetary policy as “accommodative.” 
Alternative C is written from th e perspective that a steeper po licy rate path than 
that signaled in Committee act ions and communications over rece nt years will likely be 
appropriate.  It registers some concern about potential overhea ting of the economy by 
noting that “the Committee is c losely monitoring the economic a nd financial implications 
of high levels of resource util ization.”  Consequently, under A lternative C, the 
Committee not only raises the target range but als o omits the i ndication that further rate 
increases are expected to be “gradual.” 
Alternative A is motivated by the belief that the current stanc e of monetary policy 
is at, or is very close to, neut ral, a state in w hich policy is neither expansionary nor

   contractionary.  This alternative maintains the current target range for the federal funds 
rate, no longer characterizes t he stance of monetary policy as accommodative, and 
removes the reference to “furt her gradual increases.”  Such a s tatement would be 
consistent with either the end of—or  a sustained pause in—the current tightening cycle.1  
With regard to the specifics of the language in Alternatives A,  B, and C: 
 The three alternatives have ide ntical assessments of the incomi ng data; this 
characterization is also the same as that in the August FOMC st atement.  
 With respect to the outlook for economic activity and inflation , the associated risks, 
and the monetary policy pat h upon which the outlook is conditio ned: 
o Alternative B projects “sustain ed expansion of economic activit y, strong labor 
market conditions, and inflation ne ar the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent 
objective over the medium term,”  and notes that ri sks to this o utlook are 
“roughly balanced.”  Alternative B conditions these outcomes on  “further 
gradual increases” in t he federal funds rate. 
o Motivated by the risks posed by tight labor market conditions, Alternative C 
signals that a steeper trajector y for the federal funds rate “w ill be warranted to 
achieve a sustainable expansion of economic activity, maintain strong labor 
market conditions, and keep inflation near the Committee’s symm etric 
2 percent objective ove r the medium term.”  While continuing to  describe the 
risks to the outlook as roughly ba lanced, Alternative C inserts  a cautionary 
note that “the Committee is clo sely monitoring the economic and financial 
implications of high levels  of resource utilization.” 
o Alternative A conveys that the Committee expects that the federal funds rate 
will be unchanged in the near term , noting that the “current ta rget range,” 
rather than “further gradual increases,” will support sustained  economic 
expansion and inflation near the C ommittee’s symmetric 2 percen t objective.  
 With respect to the current policy decision and the characteriz ation of the stance of 
monetary policy: 
                                                            
1 Alternatively, the Committee might view the language in Altern ative A as premature for use in 
present circumstances, but it mi ght nonetheless consider such l anguage for possible future use once the 
Committee judges that further in creases in the target range for  the federal funds rate are no longer 
warranted.

   o Alternatives B and C raise the t arget range for t he federal fun ds rate to 2 to 
2¼ percent.  Alternative B no longe r describes the stance of monetary policy 
as accommodative and, consequently, also removes the rationale provided for 
this stance—supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return 
to 2 percent inflation.  Alternativ e C retains the depiction of  monetary policy 
as remaining accommodative, but it removes the associated ratio nale, thus 
conveying a message that maintaining an accommodative stance co uld soon 
no longer be appropriate. 
o Alternative A maintain s the target range f or the federal funds rate at 1¾ to 
2 percent.  The statement removes the description of the stance  of monetary 
policy as remaining accommodative.  In combination with the rem oval of the 
reference to “further gradual increases,” such a statement woul d signal that the 
Committee judges the existing st ance of policy to be close enough to neutral 
and that no further tightening i s needed, or that a sustained p ause in raising 
rates is appropriate  to guard against the  risk of overtightenin g.

   AUGUST 2018  FOMC  STATEMENT  
1. Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in June 
indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and  that economic 
activity has been ris ing at a strong rate.  Job gains have been strong, on average, 
in recent months, and the unemplo yment rate has stayed low.  Ho usehold 
spending and business fixed invest ment have grown strongly.  On  a 12-month 
basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other tha n food and energy 
remain near 2 percent.  Indicator s of longer-term  inflation exp ectations are little 
changed, on balance. 
 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that fur ther gradual 
increases in the target range f or the federal funds rate will be consistent with 
sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market c onditions, and 
inflation near the Committee’ s symmetric 2 percent objective ov er the medium 
term.  Risks to the economic  outlook appear roughly balanced. 
 
3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and in flation, the 
Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1-3/4 
to 2 percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodat ive, thereby 
supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained retur n to 2 percent 
inflation.  
4. In determining the timing and size  of future adjustments to the  target range for the 
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expe cted economic 
conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its  symmetric 2 
percent inflation objective.  Thi s assessment will take into account a wide range 
of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of 
inflation pressures and inflati on expectations, and readings on  financial and 
international developments.

   THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
Economic Conditions and Outlook  
 Available data indicate that the  labor market has continued to strengthen. 
o Private nonfarm payroll gain s averaged about 180,000 in the thr ee months 
ending in August, a slight deceleration from earlier this year,  but still well 
above the pace that the staff es timates is consistent with no c hange in resource 
utilization. 
o The unemployment rate was 3.9 percent in July and August, down 
0.2 percentage point since the  end of 2017, and below all participants’ 
estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment in the June 
Summary of Economic Projections. 
o Average hourly earnings rose 2.9 percent over the year ending i n August, 
consistent with a tightening la bor market amid muted productivi ty growth.   
 Inflation remains close to the  Committee’s sy mmetric 2 percent goal. 
o The 12-month change in core PCE  prices is estimated to have bee n 1.9 percent 
in August.  The estimate for total PCE inflation is 2.2 percent  over the same 
period. 
o The staff projects that core PCE inflation will remain close to  2 percent 
through 2021.  Total PCE inflati on on a 12-month basis is projected to slow to 
2 percent in September and to remain there through the end of t he year; 
thereafter, total PCE inflation is projected to run a bit below  the core rate, but 
still close to 2 percent, as energy prices gra dually decline. 
o Both market- and survey-based ind icators of longer-term inflation 
expectations have moved little, on b alance, since the July/Augu st FOMC 
meeting; these measures continue  to be consistent with the view  that these 
expectations remain stable. 
 The staff estimates that output  currently stands about 2¼ perce nt above its potential 
level and anticipates that the output gap will continue to widen, reaching more than 
3 percent by the end of 2019.  In this projection, real GDP gro wth averages a bit more 
than 3 percent this year and then gradually slows to 1½ percent by 2021.  
 Risks to the outlook appear roughly balanced.  Although weaker foreign growth and 
potential trade policy developments could pose downside risks f or economic activity, 
Alternatives

   it is also possible that fiscal policy will provide a stronger- than-expected boost to 
GDP growth. 
Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers may judge that gradual removal of monetary policy accommodation 
will continue to be appropriate for some time in order to balan ce risks associated with 
overly tight resource utilizati on against the risk of unduly slowing the economy, 
potentially leading to below-target inflation.  
o An increase in the t arget range in Septemb er would be seen as c onsistent with 
the Committee’s earlier statemen ts indicating that further grad ual adjustments 
in the stance of monetary polic y would be appropriate if the ec onomy evolved 
about as anticipated. 
 Policymakers may expect that inflation will continue to run clo se to the Committee’s 
symmetric 2 percent inflation goa l as further gr adual tightenin g of monetary policy is 
carried out. 
o Policymakers may also view longer-term inflation expectations a s consistent 
with achieving the Committee’s inflation objective. 
 Policymakers may no longer see it as appropriate to state that “the stance of monetary 
policy remains accommodative.”  An increase in the target range  would still leave the 
federal funds rate below the  2.8 to 3 percent central tendency for the longer-run level 
of the federal funds rate in the  June Summary of Economic Proje ctions.  But due to 
the considerable uncertainty sur rounding estimates of the neutr al rate, it may become 
increasingly difficult to provide a reliable assessment of the stance of policy as the 
federal funds rate continues to rise.  Under these circumstance s, maintaining a 
description of the stance of policy as “accommodative” in the statement might convey a false sense of precision about  the policy stance and the neut ral level of the federal 
funds rate.  Communications chall enges associated with this description of the policy 
stance could increase over time.  
 As discussed in the “Monetary P olicy Expectatio ns and Uncertainty” box, financial 
market quotes indicate that invest ors regard the odds of a rate  hike at the upcoming 
meeting as extremely high.  Respondents to the Desk’s latest su rveys of primary 
dealers and market participants  unanimously expect a rate hike at this meeting.  Thus, 
an increase in the federal funds  rate, by itself, would likely elicit little market 
reaction.

 Monetary  Policy Expectations  and Uncertainty  
The expected  path of the federal funds rate has not changed  substantially  since 
the time of the July/August  FOMC meeting.   Market participants  continue  to 
assign high probabilities  to 25‐ basis‐point increases  in the target range  at the 
September  and December  meetings, while  expectations  for the federal  funds 
rate beyond  2018 have edged higher. 
Figure 1 shows the probabilities  of 25‐basis‐point rate hike s at each of  the next 
three FOMC  meetings, as  implied by quotes on federal funds futures contracts  
and without adjusting  for risk premiums.   The implied  probability  of a rate hike  at 
the September  meeting is now almost 100 percent.   The implied  probability of a 
rate hike at the November  meeting remains close to zero, while the odds on  a 
rate hike at the December  meeting have edged up on net over  the intermeeting  
period, from 69 to 76 percent. 
Figure 2 shows the average probability  distribution  for the level of the federal 
funds rate at  the end of 2018 implied by the Desk’s surveys.  Relative  to the 
surveys taken ahead  of the July/August  FOMC meeting,  the distribution  from the 
September  surveys suggests that  investors  have become more certain that there 
will be two 25‐ basis‐point rate  hikes by the end of the year. 
Looking further ahead, Figure  3 shows the expected  path of the federal funds 
rate through  January 2020, derived from  quotes on federal funds futures 
contracts,  assuming  zero term premiums  and no rate changes between FOMC  
meetings.  The implied  rate at the end  of 2019 has risen by about 10 basis points 
over the intermeeting  period, to about  2.85 percent,  which suggests  that 
investors  expect a total of between three  and four 25‐basis‐point rate hikes  
between now  and the end of next year.   The path also suggests  that investors  
continue to attach higher  odds for rate hikes  to occur at meetings  accompanied  
by the release of updates to the Summary  of Economic  Projections  (SEP) than  at 
meetings  without an SEP update. 
Figure 4 shows various measures  of the expected  federal funds  rate over the  
next few years.   A straight  read of the market‐based  path derived from  OIS 
quotes (the black line) suggests  that investors  expect the federal funds  rate to 
peak in early 2020 and to decline  slightly in 2021.  Adjusting  for term premiums 
using a staff term structure  model (the  light blue line)  suggests that investors  
expect a faster pace of tightening  over  the medium term, with about  five 
25‐basis‐point hikes expected  between no w and the end of 2019.  This  model‐
based path also suggests  that the federal funds rate will continue  to rise 
gradually  in 2020, similar to  the median  from the June SEP projections  (the blue 
dots).

   At horizons  up to early 2020, the model‐ based path is similar to the  modal 
projection  reported  by the median respondent  to the Desk’s latest  surveys (the 
brown line).  However, at longer  horizons,  the modal path from the surveys  lies 
below the model‐based path, and falls slightly in the second half of 2021.  The 
survey‐implied mean path  (the golden squares)  continues  to lie noticeably  below 
the survey‐implied modal path.1  In part, this reflects  the fact that the average 
probability  that respondents  assign to returning  to the effective  lower bound  by 
the end of 2021 is about 25 percent.   
Figure 5 shows the  dispersion  of respondents’  modal federal funds  rate 
projections  in the September  Desk surveys.  Each dot  is centered  on a different 
projected  rate and is scaled in size by the number of respondents  making that 
projection.  Almost all respondents  assign the highest  odds to two additional  rate 
hikes by the end of 2018.  However,  respondents’  modal projections  become 
noticeably  more dispersed  at longer  horizons.   In particular,  a small number  of 
respondents  have modal projections  that decline substantially  in 2020 and/or 
2021, while only one  respondent has  a modal projection  for the federal  funds rate 
to rise above  4 percent by the end of 2021. 
Figure 6 shows measures  of the longer‐run expected  federal funds  rate over the 
past five years.  A straight  read of long‐term forward rates  implied by Treasury  
securities  (the red line) suggests  that investors’  expectations  for the average 
federal funds  rate from  5 to 10 years ahead are currently  about 3.2 percent.   
Adjusting  for term premiums using  various staff term structure  models (with the  
blue region showing  a range of such point estimates  from three models)  
suggests that 5‐to‐ 10‐year‐ ahead expecta tions are above the unadjusted  forward 
rates, at between 3.3 and  3.9 percent.   In contrast,  surveys of  professional  
forecasters  suggest that longer‐run expectations  lie at or below the unadjusted  
forward rates;  the average longer‐run forecast  from the June Blue  Chip survey 
(the yellow diamonds)  and the median forecast  from the September  Desk 
surveys (the green diamonds)  were 3 and 2.9 percent, respectively. 
Since the start  of the current tightening  cycle in December  2015, the  estimates  of 
longer‐run federal  funds rate expectatio ns from the models and surveys have 
moved in opposite  directions,  on net; the model‐ based estimates  are currently  
between about  15 and 40 basis points higher than at the time of the December  
2015 FOMC meeting,  while the Blue Chip  and Desk longer‐run survey  measures  
are 30 and about 40 basis points lower, r espectively, than  at the time  of the 
December  2015 surveys.  This discrepancy  between the  models and the surveys 
highlights  the difficulty  of measuring  long‐term expectations  for interest  rates. 
                                                 
1 The mean path is constructed  by combining  respondents’  probability  distributions  for 
the federal funds rate conditional  on either moving  or not moving  to the effective lower bound 
at any point by the end of 2021.  The modal path reflects  the median of the respondents’  modal 
projections  for the federal funds rate through the end of 2021.

   o It is less clear how financial markets might react to the remov al of the 
sentence characterizing the stance of monetary policy as accomm odative.  
This change in the statement shoul d not come as a complete surp rise because 
the FOMC minutes released in Aug ust indicated that the Committe e agreed 
that this language would “at  some point fairly soon, no longer be appropriate.”  
In the Desk’s surveys, roughl y one-half of respondents did not explicitly 
indicate any expectation regarding the “remains accommodative” language.  
Of those respondents who did explic itly comment on the “remains  
accommodative” language, the responses were mixed, with about a third 
expecting the language to be rem oved and a third expecting it t o be modified.2  
Consequently, the removal of the “remains accommodative” langua ge at this 
meeting may be somewhat surprisi ng to some market contacts.

 Policymakers may judge that the la bor market is operating appre ciably beyond full 
employment and that economic ac tivity—which is expanding at a f aster-than-
sustainable rate—will conti nue to be spurred by expansionary fi scal policy.   
o The unemployment rate remains below each FOMC participant’s est imate of 
its longer-run normal level and is  projected to decline further .  Other 
indicators also point to an already-tight labor market; these include a record-high job openings rate, continued reports of firms having diffi culty hiring 
workers, and low levels of initial claims for unemployment insurance. 
 Policymakers may judge that the eco nomy is stronger than previo usly expected.  
Payroll gains continue to indicate a tightening of the labor ma rket, and—even after 
accounting for factors that are expected to be transitory—the r ebound of real GDP 
growth in the second quarter a ppears to have been strong.  Thes e developments may 
suggest that the neutral federa l funds rate is higher, and the current monetary policy 
stance is more accommodative, than previously estimated. 
 Policymakers may predict that unwanted upward pressure on inflation is likely to 
emerge amid a prolonged period of significant labor market tigh tness.  Policymakers 
                                                            
2  These findings were captured through a standing, open-ended q uestion regarding expectations 
for changes, if any, to the language referencing communication on the expected path of the target federal 
funds rate.

   may point to the fact that aver age hourly earnings rose 2.9 per cent over the year 
ending in August, the highest 12- month increase since 2009, as evidence of incipient 
increases in wage and price inflation.  
 Despite seven increases in the target range for the federal fun ds rate between 
December 2015 and June 2018 and a net appreciation of the dollar, financial 
conditions have, by some measures, eased on balance since December 2015.  In 
particular, the spreads between r ates on certain investment- an d speculative-grade 
corporate bonds and rates on equiva lent-maturity Treasury secur ities have fallen 
substantially over th is period, while equity prices have increa sed sharply.  Moreover, 
as discussed in the box “How Have  Business and Household Borrow ing Conditions 
Changed Over the Past Year?” in Tealbook A, while the federal f unds rate and key 
interest rates for household and bus iness borrowers have increased over the past year, 
borrowing conditions have not exhibited a commensurate tighteni ng, in part because 
of an easing in nonprice cred it terms and standards.   
Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers may judge that a fa ster removal of policy accommod ation than has been 
suggested by previous FOMC comm unications is necessary in the n ear term to avoid 
significant overheating. 
o Policymakers may be concerned that ongoing above-trend economic  growth 
and an already-strong labor market that continues to tighten co uld soon result 
in more notable upward pressure on inflation. 
o They may also judge that a steeper  trajectory of rate hikes is needed to prevent 
the unemployment rate from dec lining significantly further belo w its normal 
longer-run value; such a further  decline could make it increasi ngly 
challenging to engineer a soft landing as inflation picks up. 
o Additionally, amid elevated asset  valuations and high levels of  debt at risky 
firms, policymakers may see the need for a somewhat faster pace  of rate 
increases to avoid a significant  buildup of financial imbalance s.  
 For the above reasons, policymak ers may opt to increase the tar get range for the 
federal funds rate to 2 to 2¼ per cent at this meeting and to om it statement language 
characterizing the future pace  of tightening as gradual. 
o In addition, while policymakers may still wish to characterize the stance of 
monetary policy as remaining accommodative, they may prefer not to describe 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
September 20, 2018
Page 14 of 34

   the new level of the target range as “supporting strong labor m arket conditions 
and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.”  Removing this description 
would be intended to relay policym akers’ judgment that maintaining an 
accommodative stance could soon no longer be appropriate. 
o Moreover, policymakers may wish t o signal that the Committee no w judges 
that a steeper path for the feder al funds rate—steeper than sug gested by the 
Committee’s previous communications—“will be warranted to achieve a 
sustainable expansion of  economic activity, maintain strong labor market 
conditions, and keep inflation near t he Committee’s symmetric 2 percent 
objective over the medium term.” 
 Policymakers may also wish to communicate in paragraph 2 that “the Committee is 
closely monitoring the economic a nd financial implications of h igh levels of resource 
utilization,” signaling concern a bout the risks associated with overheating, including 
the possibility that a prolonge d period of high resource utiliz ation might cause a 
significant buildup of financial imbalances. 
 The adoption of Alternative C woul d likely come as a surprise t o market participants.  
Market participants could read s uch a statement as indicating t hat the Committee 
intends to raise the federal funds rate more rapidly than previ ously expected.  
Medium- and longer-term real inter est rates could rise, as could the exchange value of 
the dollar; equity prices and inf lation compensation could fall . 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 Policymakers may see that inflation has moved close to 2 percent and that it is projected to remain close to tha t level on a sustained basis.  
 Moreover, policymakers may view  the labor market as operating c lose to or at full 
employment.  The unemployment ra te is little changed since the start of the year; the 
labor force participation rate  has stayed about the same, on ba lance, over the past four 
years.   
 Policymakers may observe that, t hough real GDP is currently ris ing at a brisk pace, a 
gradual slowing of growth is projected over the next few years,  in part reflecting 
waning fiscal impetus.  
Alternatives

    Policymakers could judge that the current level of the federal funds rate lies within 
the confidence bands of a range of  estimates of the neutral lev el for the federal funds 
rate.  Furthermore, they may see developments in Treasury marke ts—particularly the 
flattening yield curve—as supporti ng the view that current poli cy is close to neutral. 
Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers may assess that bot h objectives of the dual mandat e are as close to 
being fulfilled as in any time in recent memory.  They may cons equently judge it 
prudent to stop the gradual increases in the federal funds rate  so as not to undermine 
the expansion of economic activ ity and the susta ined return of inflation to 2 percent.3 
o Policymakers may note that, while the expansion has been robust , the 
economy has shown few signs of overheating.  The labor market h as 
improved at a remarkably steady pace over the past few years wi thout 
generating a large increase in e ither nominal wage growth or inflation.  
Moreover, inflation expectations  have remained stable over this  period.   
o Policymakers may also view substantial risks asso ciated with tightening too 
quickly or too much.  Such policy actions could undermine the e xpansion or 
cause inflation to run persistentl y below the Committee’s 2 per cent objective.  
An overly restrictive policy stanc e could be reflected in an in version of the 
yield curve, something that has in the past been associated wit h recessions.  
Furthermore, a slowdown in grow th abroad or new trade policy developments 
could also restrain the econo my over the near term.   
o Finally, policymakers might note that monetary policy affects e conomic 
activity with a lag, and that the removal of accommodation that  has taken 
place over the past few years will  continue to act as a restraint on economic 
growth for some time, mitigating the need for more increases in  the target 
range federal funds rate at this stage. 
 Policymakers may continue to view t he current state of the financial system as sound 
and the potential for a buildup of r isks to financial stability as limited, or they may 
judge that interest rate policy is not an effective means of addressing any significant 
financial stability concerns that may emerge. 
                                                            
3  Conversely, policymakers might v iew the gradual removal of accommodation as still warranted 
for the time being, but might consider the language in Alternat ive A as a template for a future policy 
statement.

    A statement along the lines of A lternative A would likely be re garded as an important 
change in the Committee’s polic y outlook and would reduce expec tations of rate 
hikes in the near future.   Such a statement could cause medium and longer-term 
interest rates to fall, while a dditionally leading to a decline  in the exchange value of 
the dollar.  Equity prices and inflation compensation could ris e.

rate, an implementation note th at indicates no change in the ad ministered rates—the 
interest rates on required and ex cess reserves, the offering ra te on overnight reverse 
repurchase agreements, and the pr imary credit rate—would be iss ued.  If the Committee 
decides to raise the target range  for the federal funds rate, a n implementation note that 
communicates the changes the Fed eral Reserve decided to make in  these three policy 
tools would be issued.  Draft im plementation notes that corresp ond to these two cases

Balance Sheet and Income Projections 
The staff has prepared projecti ons of the Federal Reserve’s bal ance sheet and 
elements of the associated incom e statement that are consistent  with the baseline 
economic outlook presented in Tealbook A.  Key features of thes e projections are 
described below.  
SOMA redemptions and reinvestments.   As reported in t he exhibit titled 
“Redemptions and Reinvestments of SOMA Principal Payments,” the  staff projects that 
the balance sheet normalization program initiated in October 20 17 will lead to the 
redemption of $229 billion of Treasury securities and about $15 2 billion of agency 
securities over 2018.1  During this same period, $197 billi on of principal from matur ing 
Treasury securities and about  $72 billion of principal from age ncy securities will be 
reinvested.  Under the staff’s current baseline forecast of ris ing longer-term int erest rates, 
reinvestments of agency securi ties are projected to cease by Oc tober of this year, when 
the cap on monthly redemptions of  agency securities rises to it s $20 billion maximum.2 
However, the projections for age ncy securities are subject to c onsiderable uncertainty 
because unscheduled prepayments depend on factors that are diff icult to predict, 
including the realized path of mortgage rates.3 
Evolution of the size of the balance sheet.   One key assumption behind the 
balance sheet projection is that the longer-run level of reserv e balances will be $500 
billion.4  Using the baseline economic outlook in the September Tealbook , the projected 
1 Projections include a preliminar y estimate of September 2018 p rincipal payments from agency 
securities. 
2 Once the cap on monthly reductions in SOMA holdings of Treasur y securities has been fully 
phased in, reinvestments of principal from maturing Treasury se curities will take place primarily in the 
middle month of each quarter.   
3 If actual principal payments w ere to breach the $20 billion cap before the size of the balance 
sheet is normalized, t hen the Desk would reinvest in MBS the am ount by which the principal payments 
received during any m onth exceeds the cap.  F or further details , see the FOMC memo titled “Operational 
Readiness for MBS Reinvestments” (June 2018). 
4 Other noteworthy assumptions  about liability items underlying the projections are as follows:  
The Treasury General Account is a ssumed to increase in line wit h nominal GDP; Federal Reserve notes in 
circulation are assumed to incr ease at an average annual pace o f about 6 percent through 2020 and at the 
same pace as nominal GDP thereafter; the foreign repo pool and balances in the accounts of designated 
financial market utilities remain at their August 2018 levels o f approximately $240 billion and $65 billion,

redemption of securities from the Federal Reserve’s portfolio, as well as other 
assumptions, this level of reserve balances will be reached in the second quarter of 2021, 
unchanged from the July Tealbook pr ojection (see the exhibit ti tled “Total Assets and 
Selected Balance Sheet Items” a nd the table that follows the ex hibit).5 
From the start of the balance sheet reduction program in Octobe r 2017 to its 
projected conclusion in 2021, when the size of the balance shee t normalizes, the Federal 
Reserve’s securities  holdings are predict ed to decline about $1 .3 trillion, wit h holdings of 
Treasury and agency securitie s shrinking about $800 billion and $500 billion, 
respectively.  When the size of  the balance sheet is normalized, the SOMA portfolio is 
projected to be just a touch less than $3 trillion, consisting of about $1.7 trillion in 
Treasury securities and $1.3 trill ion in agency securities.   
Once the declines in asset holdi ngs associated with normalizati on have taken 
place, the size of the balance sheet is projected to stand at roughly 13 percent of nominal 
GDP, compared with a peak of a bout 25 percent in 2014 and a pre -crisis average of about 
6 percent.  After the size of the  balance sheet is normalized, SOMA holdings will begin 
to rise, keeping pace with the inc reases in Federal Reserve lia bilities—including Federal 
Reserve notes in circulation and t he Treasury General Account ( TGA)—as well as 
Federal Reserve Bank capital.  Expressed as shares of nominal GDP, Federal Reserve 
assets and liabilities a re expected to edge down. 
Federal Reserve remittances.   Remittances to the Treasury are projected to 
decline to $62 billion this  year from $80 billion in 2017 (see the “Income Projections” 
exhibit).6  This decline primarily reflect s the realized and expected inc reases in the 
respectively; and take-up at the overnight RRP facility, which averaged under $2 billion in August 2018, is 
assumed to be $0. 
5 Many factors will influence th e size of the balance sheet upon  normalization, including banks’ 
post-crisis underlying demand for reserves.  Generally speaking , the size of the balance  sheet is considered 
to be normalized when the resumption of purchases of Treasury s ecurities is required to satisfy demand for 
reserve balances and accommodate the expansion of other key non-reserve liability items. 
6 This estimate includes two mandated transfers to the Treasury due to reductions to the statutory 
limit on aggregate Reserve Bank  surplus.  First , $2.5 billion w as transferred in February as a result of 
Section 7 of the Federal Reserve Act being amended by the Bipar tisan Budget Act of 2018, enacted in 
February 2018.  Second, $675 mill ion was transferred in June, r eflecting Section 7 being amended by the 
Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act  enacted in May 2018.

interest rate pai d on reserves in 2018.7  Total annual interest expe nse is projected to rise 
by $16 billion to $46 billion this year, w hile interest income from SOMA holdings is 
expected to decline slightly, to $112 billion.  As the target r ange for the federal funds rate 
moves up and interest expense on r eserve balances increases, re mittances are expected to 
decline further and to bott om out at $33 billion in 2020.  Thereafter, remittances increase 
due to a decrease in interest expense as the target range for the federal funds rate is 
projected to decline, and to the i ncrease in interest income as  the Desk resumes purchases 
of Treasury securities f or the SOMA portfolio. 
The projected path for remittances over the next few years is s imilar to that in the 
July Tealbook.  As shown in the botto m left panel of the “Incom e Projections” exhibit, 
annual remittances average about 0.25 percent of nominal GDP ov er the projection 
period, slightly higher than t heir pre-crisis average. 
Unrealized gains or losses.   The SOMA portfolio was  in a net unrealized loss 
position of about $25 billion at the end of August.  With longe r-term interest rates 
expected to rise further over th e next several years, the unrea lized loss position is 
expected to peak at $260 billion in 2020:Q3.  Of this amount, $105 billion is attributable to Treasury securities and $155 billion to agency MBS.  The unr ealized loss position 
subsequently narrows, in large part because the value of securi ties acquired under the 
Federal Reserve’s large-scale asset purchase programs returns t o par as those securities 
approach maturity.  The net unrea lized position over the projec tion period is little 
changed from the July Tealbook. 
Term premium effect.   As shown in the table “Pr ojections for the 10-Year 
Treasury Term Premium Effect,” SOMA securities held as a result  of the Federal 
Reserve’s asset purchase program s are currently estimated to be  reducing the term 
premium in the 10-year Treas ury yield by about 80 basis points, the same as in the 
previous Tealbook; this effect i s projected to fade gradually o ver time.  The estimated 
path of the term premium effect  depends on the difference betwe en the expected path of 
the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet over coming years and a ben chmark counterfactual 
projection based on the configurat ion of the balan ce sheet that  prevailed before the 
7 We continue to assume that the FOMC will set a 25 -basis-point-wide target range for the federal 
funds rate throughout the projection period.  Consistent with t he August FOMC Implementation Note, we 
assume that the interest rates p aid on reserve balances will be set five basis points below the top of the 
target range for the federal fu nds rate. We continue to assume  that the offering rate on overnight RRPs will 
be set at the bottom of the range.

financial crisis of 2007 2008.  In this counterfactual projection it is assumed that res erve 
balances reach their l onger-run value at $100 billion.   
SOMA characteristics.  As shown in the top panel of t he “Projections for the 
Characteristics of SOMA Treasury S ecurities Holdings” exhibit, the weighted-average 
duration of the SOMA Treasury port folio is currently about six years.  This measure is 
projected to increase over the co urse of balance sheet size normalization, as the pace of 
redemptions picks up and longer-dur ation securities become a la rger share of the 
portfolio.  In terms of the composition of the portfolio, the s hare of agency MBS is 
expected to peak at 44 percent shortly before the size of the b alance sheet is expected to 
be normalized, reflecting the fas ter pace of roll-offs of Treas ury securities, and then to 
decline to less tha n 30 percent at the end of 2024. 
After normalization of the si ze of the balance sheet in 2021, t he duration of the 
SOMA Treasury portfolio is project ed to decline as the Desk beg ins adding securities to 
the SOMA portfolio to keep pace with the expansion in non-reser ve liabilities.  The 
initial sharp decline in duration results from the staff’s assu mption that the Desk will 
purchase only Treasury bills until these securities account for  one-third of the Federal 
Reserve’s Treasury securities po rtfolio, close to their pre-cri sis share.8  Thereafter, 
purchases of Treasury securities are assumed to be spread across the maturity spectrum 
(see the bottom panel of the exhi bit titled “Proj ections for th e Characteristics of SOMA 
Treasury Securities Holdings”).   
8 Currently, excluding small-value test operations, the SOMA por tfolio contains no Treasury bills.
