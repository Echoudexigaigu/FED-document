Information received since the Committee met in September indic ates that the 
labor market has continued to strengthen, with the unemployment  rate falling to 
3.7 percent in September and payr olls continuing to expand strongly.  Real GDP is 
estimated to have grown by about 3 p ercent over the past four q uarters.  The staff projects 
above-trend real GDP growth through 2019 and high levels of resource utilization over 
the medium term.  The 12-month changes in headline and core PCE  prices were each 
2 percent in September.  The staff forecasts both headline and core PCE inflation to 
remain close to 2 percent through 2021. 
Against this backdrop, the alternative policy statements presen ted below offer a 
range of policy options and assessm ents about the outlook for p olicy.  Alternative B is 
based on the view that the econom y has been evolving broadly in  line with expectations 
and, as a result, that the outlook for policy implied by recent  FOMC communications 
remains appropriate.  Under this alternative, the Committee would maintain the target range for the federal funds rate and reiterate the expectation that further gradual increases 
in the target range will be c onsistent with achieving its goals . 
Alternative C is written from the perspective that the incoming  data continue to be 
stronger than is sustainable a nd that, in order to contain even tual inflation risks, the 
FOMC should signal that the federal funds rate will likely need  to rise to a higher level 
than has been implied by previous communications.  Under this a lternative, the 
Committee would raise the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting and 
signal that further gra dual increases are l ikely to continue “f or some time” in order to 
contain inflation risks resulting from high levels of resource utilization.  While the 
Committee might judge that the ad option of Alternative C is not  warranted at this 
meeting, the statement could be view ed as a draft template for a contingency in which the 
Committee becomes concerned about  inflation rising appreciably above 2 percent. 
Alternative A is motivated by the belief that the current stanc e of monetary policy 
is appropriately at, or very clo se to, neutral—a state in which  policy is neither 
expansionary nor contractionary—and that further increases in t he target range for the 
federal funds rate at this st age could unduly slow the economic  expansion and forestall 
the sustained return of inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective.  Under this

alternative, the Committee woul d maintain the current target ra nge for the federal funds 
rate and would signal a pause in—o r the end of—the current tigh tening cycle.   
While the Committee might view the  language in Alternative A as  premature in 
present circumstances, it might  nonetheless consider such langu age for possible future 
use once the Committee judges that  further increases in the target range for the federal 
funds rate are no longer warrant ed.  In the period leading up t o such a judgment, a 
communications challenge is w hen and how to transition away fro m the guidance that the 
FOMC expects “further gradual increases” in the target range for the federal funds rate.  
As background, a box titled “The ‘Measured Pace’ Language and S ubsequent 
Communications” recounts the FOM C’s transition away from the “m easured pace” 
language in 2005 and 2006. 
With regard to the specifics of the language in Alternatives A,  B, and C: 
 The assessment of the incoming data: 
o Alternatives A and B have identic al characterizations of the in coming data.  
This characterization is similar to that in the September FOMC statement, but 
notes that “growth of business fi xed investment has moderated f rom its rapid 
pace earlier in the year” and also that the unemployment rate h as “declined.”1 
o Alternative C emphasizes that th e labor market “continued to ti ghten,” citing 
“robust” job gains and noting tha t “the unemployment rate has r eached multi-
decade lows.”  Like Alternatives A and B, Alternative C points out that 
“growth of business fixed investment has moderated from its rap id pace 
earlier in the year.” 
 The outlook for economic activity  and inflation, the associated  risks, and the 
monetary policy path upon whic h the outlook is conditioned: 
o Alternative B projects “sustain ed expansion of economic activit y, strong labor 
market conditions, and inflation ne ar the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent 
objective over the medium term,”  and notes that ri sks to this o utlook are 
“roughly balanced.”  These outcome s are achieved with “further gradual 
increases” in the target range  for the federal funds rate. 
1 The language in the draft altern ative statements related to th e labor market may need to be 
adjusted in light of the employment report for October, which i s scheduled to be released on Friday, 
November 2, 2018.

o Alternative C offers essentially the same outlook for economic activity, the 
labor market, and inflation as Alternative B, but conditions th is outlook on 
“further gradual increases” cont inuing “for some time.”  Altern ative C states 
that risks are “roughly balanced ” only for the outlook for econ omic activity 
and adds a cautionary note that “The Committee is monitoring in flation 
developments closely.” 
o Alternative A offers the same  outlook for economic activity and  inflation as 
Alternative B.  However, under A lternative A, the Committee no longer 
conditions the economic outlook on “further gradual increases” in the target 
range for the federal funds rate,  and instead conveys the expec tation that “the 
current target range for the fed eral funds rate will, for a time, be consistent 
with” sustained economic expansio n and inflation near the Commi ttee’s 
symmetric 2 percent objective.  
 The current policy decision a nd the outlook for policy: 
o Alternative B maintain s the target range f or the federal funds rate at 2 to 
2¼ percent.  With the outlook cond itioned on “further gradual increases” in 
the target range for the feder al funds rate, such a statement w ould signal little 
change in the Committee’s outlook for policy.  
o Alternative C raises the target range for the federal funds rat e to 2¼ to 
2½ percent, and notes that “This decision should help guard aga inst the risk 
that excessive inflation pressu res will emerge amid increasingly high levels of 
resource utilization.”2  With “further gradual increas es” in the target range for 
the federal funds rate expected “ for some time,” such a statement would signal 
that the Committee judges that it will eventually need to raise  the federal 
funds rate to a higher level than has been implied by previous 
communications.  
o Alternative A maintain s the target range f or the federal funds rate at 2 to 
2¼ percent.  By removing the refer ence to “further gradual incr eases” and 
indicating that the target range  for the federal funds rate is expected to stay at 
its current level “for a time,” such a statement would signal t hat the 
Committee judges the existing st ance of policy to be close enough to neutral 
2 The implementation note associated with Alternative C embeds t he assumption that, along with 
the increase in the target range  for the federal funds rate, th e Federal Reserve would make a technical 
realignment of the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances relative to  the top of the target 
range for the federal funds rate.

The “Measured Pace” Language and Subsequent Communications 
A key communications challenge the FOMC is likely to face before too long is when and how 
to transition away from guidance in the postmeeting statement that the Committee expects 
“further gradual increases” in the target range for the federal funds rate. The Committee 
faced a similar decision in late 2005 and early 2006 as it transitioned away from guidance 
characterizing the pace at which policy accommodation could be removed. This box reviews 
the Committee’s discussions at FOMC meetings over the period that preceded the removal 
of the “measured pace” language from the postmeeting statement and the later removal of 
guidance regarding additi onal policy “firming.” 
Between June 2004 and June 2006, the Committee raised the federal funds rate target at 
17 consecutive meetings (figure 1). Beginning with the May 2004 FOMC postmeeting 
statement, and in each postmeeting statement through November 2005, the Committee 
communicated its judgment that “policy accommodation” could be “removed at a pace that 
is likely to be measured.” In the latter half of 2005, the FOMC’s discussions about whether 
to continue including the “measured pace” language in the postmeeting statement 
intensified. 
The discussions at the December 2005 FOMC meeting reveal that a number of participants 
believed that the “measured pace” language had come to imply an increase in the federal 
funds rate target by 25 basis points at the next meeting and had outlived its usefulness. Half 
of respondents to the Desk’s December 2005 Survey of Primary Dealers expected the 
“measured pace” language to be modified or removed. In the December 2005 postmeeting 
statement, the Committee modified its usage of “measured,” and indicated that “some 
further measured policy firming is likely to be needed.”1 Retaining the word was generally 
seen as providing continuity with previous statements and indicating that the federal funds 
rate target was unlikely to rise by more than 25 basis points at the next meeting. In January 
2006, the Committee removed the word “measured” from the postmeeting statement 
altogether. 
Over the first half of 2006, FOMC meeting participants saw the policy outlook as becoming 
less certain and increasingly dependent on incoming data. In the January 2006 and March 
2006 postmeeting statements, the Committee no longer indicated that further increases in 
the federal funds rate were “likely.” Instead, it provided guidance that “the Committee 
judges that some further policy firming may be needed,” indicating less certainty that the 
period of successive rate increases would continue. In May 2006, the FOMC further 
modified the guidance to say that “some further policy firming may yet be needed,” and 
emphasized that “the extent and timing of any such firming” would depend on economic 
developments and the outlook. In their discussions at the June 2006 FOMC meeting, 
participants expressed a range of views about the risks to the outlook, though all were 
1 In the December 2005 postmeeting statement, the Committee also removed reference to the 
stance of monetary policy being “accommodative.” This matter was discussed in the box titled “The 
Removal of the ‘Remains Accommodative’ Language in 2005” in Tealbook B of July 2018.

concerned about elevated readings on core inflation. At that meeting, the FOMC decided to 
raise the federal funds rate target and, reflecting the risk that inflation would not moderate, 
to offer guidance that “the extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed” 
would depend on the incoming information. 
Responses to the Desk’s dealer survey and contemporaneous media reports suggest that 
FOMC communications in late 2005 and early 2006 were reasonably successful in aligning 
the public’s interpretation of the transition away from the “measured pace” language with 
the Committee’s intentions. Near term expectations for policy were mostly unchanged after 
the usage of “measured” was modified in December 2005. Additionally, market 
commentaries reported that the change in statement language in January 2006 that was 
associated with the removal of the word “measured” underscored the fact that any future 
increases in the federal funds rate would depend on incoming data. 
In late 2006 and early 2007, as the FOMC kept the federal funds rate target unchanged at 
5.25 percent, the Committee considered removing the “additional firming” language. The 
March 2007 FOMC meeting transcript indicates two broad views among FOMC participants 
with regard to removing this language. One view was that retaining the reference to 
“additional firming” would lean against the perception that the Committee would be 
satisfied with inflation continuing at its current level. The other view was that incoming data 
on economic activity had been mixed, that inflation was projected to moderate, and that a 
shift to “future policy adjustments” better reflected downside risks to economi c activity that 
had become more apparent. In the March 2007 postmeeting statement, the Committee 
decided to drop its reference to “additional firming” and instead state that “future policy 
adjustments” would depend on incoming data.

and that no further tightening i s expected to be necessary, or that a meaningful 
pause in raising rates is appropr iate to guard against the risk  of overtightening.  
With no reference to the directi on of future changes in the target range, such a 
statement would also highlight t he Committee’s continued guidan ce that “the 
timing and size of future adjustme nts to the target range for t he federal funds 
rate” will need to be evaluate d in light of incoming informatio n.

SEPTEMBER 2018 FOMC STATEMENT 
1. Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in August 
indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and  that economic 
activity has been ris ing at a strong rate.  Job gains have been strong, on average, 
in recent months, and the unemplo yment rate has stayed low.  Ho usehold 
spending and business fixed invest ment have grown strongly.  On  a 12-month 
basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other tha n food and energy 
remain near 2 percent.  Indicator s of longer-term  inflation exp ectations are little 
changed, on balance. 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that fur ther gradual 
increases in the target range f or the federal funds rate will be consistent with 
sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market c onditions, and 
inflation near the Committee’ s symmetric 2 percent objective ov er the medium 
term.  Risks to the economic  outlook appear roughly balanced. 
3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and in flation, the 
Committee decided to rai se the target range for the federal fun ds rate to 2 to 2-1/4 
percent. 
4. In determining the timing and size  of future adjustments to the  target range for the 
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expe cted economic 
conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its  symmetric 2 
percent inflation objective.  Thi s assessment will take into account a wide range 
of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of 
inflation pressures and inflati on expectations, and readings on  financial and 
international developments.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 Available data indicate that the  labor market has continued to strengthen. 
o Nonfarm payroll gains averag ed about 190,000 in the three month s ending in 
September, well above the pace that the staff projects is consi stent with no 
change in resour ce utilization. 
o The unemployment rate edged down to 3.7 percent in September, d own 
0.4 percentage point since the  end of 2017, and below all participants’ 
estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment in the September 
Summary of Economic Projections. 
o Average hourly earnings rose 2.8 percent over the year ending i n September 
and the Employment Cost Index rose 2.9 percent over the same pe riod, 
consistent with a tight labor m arket amid muted productivity gr owth. 
 Inflation remains close to the  Committee’s sy mmetric 2 percent goal. 
o The 12-month change in both headline and core PCE prices was 2 percent in 
September. 
o The staff projects headline and c ore PCE inflation to remain cl ose to 2 percent 
over the medium term. 
o Both market- and survey-based ind icators of longer-term inflation 
expectations continue to be cons istent with the view that these expectations 
remain stable. 
 Financial conditions have recently tightened but remain support ive of the economic 
expansion.  Although equity prices  have declined and house pric es have been weaker 
than expected, these market deve lopments have not materially al tered the outlook. 
 The staff estimates that output  currently stands about 2½ perce nt above its potential 
level, and anticipates that the output gap will widen to around  3 percent in 2020 
before narrowing.  
 Risks to the outlook appear roughly balanced.  Although weaker foreign growth and 
potential trade policy developments could pose downside risks f or economic activity, 
it is also possible that fiscal policy will provide a stronger- than-expected boost to 
GDP growth.

Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers may see economic conditions as continuing to evolv e in line with their 
expectations.  With Alternative B, policymakers would continue to signal that the 
economic outlook calls for further  gradual increases in the tar get range for the federal 
funds rate, but, in light of the three increases earlier this year, not for an adjustment to 
the stance of monetary polic y at the November meeting. 
o Policymakers may judge that gradual removal of monetary policy 
accommodation will continue to be appropriate in order to balan ce risks 
associated with overly tight resou rce utilization against the r isk of unduly 
slowing the economy, potentiall y leading to below-target inflat ion.  
 Policymakers may expect that inflation will continue to run clo se to the Committee’s 
symmetric 2 percent inflation goa l as further gr adual tightenin g of monetary policy is 
carried out. 
o Policymakers may see the removal of accommodation that has take n place 
over the past few years, and futur e gradual increases in the federal funds rate 
together with ongoing balance-shee t reductions, as containing t he risk that 
inflation will rise appr eciably above 2 percent. 
o Policymakers may also view longer-term inflation expectations a s consistent 
with achieving the Committee’s inflation objective. 
 A statement along the lines of A lternative B seems unlikely to generate appreciable 
changes in asset prices.  As discussed in the “Monetary Policy Expectations and Uncertainty” box, financial marke t quotes indicate that investo rs regard the odds of a 
rate hike at the upcoming meeti ng as negligible; the next rate hike is viewed as very 
likely to occur in December.  The assessment of respondents to the Desk’s latest 
surveys of primary dealers and mar ket participants is similar.

Monetary Policy Expectations and Uncertainty 
Measures of monetary policy expectations were mostly little changed since the 
September FOMC meeting. Investors continue to assign a high probability to a 
25basis point rate increase at the December meeting, and expectations for the 
federal funds rate for 2019 and beyond were about unchanged on net. 
A straight read of quotes on federal funds futures suggests that investors 
continue to attach a near zero probability of a 25basis point rate hike at the 
November meeting, while the probability of a rate increase in December remains 
close to 75 percent (the blue bars in figure 1). The calculation of these 
probabilities does not take into account a potential technical adjustment to the 
interest rate paid on excess reserve balances (IOER). Using the alternative 
assumption of a 5basis point adjustment at the December meeting, these quotes 
would instead imply that investors are near certain of a rate hike in December 
(the red bar). Results from the Novembe r Desk surveys showed that most 
respondents expected the spread between the top of the target range for the 
federal funds rate and the IOER rate to widen from the current 5 basis points to 
10 basis points following the December meeting. Just four respondents 
expected a widening following the November meeting. 
Figure 2 shows the expected path of the federal funds rate through January 
2020, derived from quotes on federal funds futures contracts, assuming zero 
term premiums and no rate changes between meetings. The path, which was 
little changed on net over the intermeeting period, suggests that the 
announcement of press conferences being held after every FOMC meeting 
starting in 2019 has not changed market expectations of the timing of rate 
changes. 
Figure 3 shows that the average probability distribution for the level of the 
federal funds rate at the end of 2019, based on Eurodollar options quotes and 
assuming zero term premiums, has changed only slightly. It implies that 
investors place the highest odds on the federal funds rate being in the 2¾to3
percent range at the end of 2019—which corresponds to a total of three 25basis
point rate hikes between now and the end of 2019—followed closely by the 2½
to2¾ percent range. The corresponding average probability distribution from 
the latest Desk surveys (not shown) shows roughly comparable probabilities. 
Looking further ahead, figure 4 shows various measures of the expected federal 
funds rate over the next few years. A straight read of the market based path 
derived from overnight index swaps (OIS) quotes (the black line) suggests that 
investors expect the federal funds rate to increase through the end of 2019, and 
to decline slightly afterwards. Adjusting for term premiums using a staff term 
structure model (the light blue line) suggests that investors expect a faster pace 
of tightening over the medium term, with about four 25basis point rate hikes

expected between now and the end of 2019. This model based path also 
suggests that the federal funds rate will continue to rise gradually in 2020, similar 
to the median from the September SEP projections (the blue dots). At horizons 
up to early 2020, the model based path is similar to the modal projection 
reported by the median respondent to the Desk’s latest surveys (the brown line). 
However, at longer horizons, the modal path from the surveys lies below the 
model based path, and falls slightly in the second half of 2021. The survey implied 
mean path (the golden squares) continues to lie noticeably below the survey
implied modal path beyond 2019.1 This reflects in part the fact that the average 
probability that respondents assign to returning to the effective lower bound by 
the end of 2021 is about 25 percent. The average survey implied mean estimate 
for the federal funds rate for the end of 2019 increased by about 50 basis points 
relative to the September Desk surveys. This increase is likely attributable, at 
least in part, to changes in the phrasing of the survey questions between the 
September and November surveys. 
Figure 5 shows time series measures of the longer run expected federal funds 
rate. A straight read of long term forward rates implied by Treasury securities 
(the red line) suggests that investors’ current expectations for the average 
federal funds rate from 5 to 10 years ahead are about 3.2 percent, little changed 
from the September FOMC meeting. Adjusting for term premiums using various 
staff term structure models (with the blue region showing a range of three such 
model estimates) continu es to suggest that 5to10year ahead expectations are 
above the unadjusted forward rates, at between 3.3 and 3.9 percent. In contrast, 
surveys of professional forecasters suggest that longer run expectations lie at or 
below the unadjusted forward rates; the average longer run forecast from the 
June Blue Chip survey (the yellow diamonds) and the median forecast from the 
latest Desk surveys (the green diamonds) were 3.0 and 2.9 percent, respectively. 
Figure 6 shows responses to a question in the Desk surveys that asks 
respondents for their projections for the most likely spread between the IOER 
rate and the effective federal funds rate (EFFR), conditional on a range of 
possible levels of reserve balances.2 Relative to the August Desk surveys, the 
current estimates reflect the recent decline in the IOER EFFR spread to zero. In 
addition, the median respondent expects that the EFFR will lie 5 basis points 
above the IOER when reserve balances reach a level of $1 trillion. 
1 The modal path reflects the median of the respondents’ modal projections for the 
federal funds rate through the end of 2021. The survey implied mean path is calculated by 
averaging over individual respondents’ probability distributions for the end of 2019, 2020 and 
2021. 
2 Respondents were also asked to rate the importance of various factors in influencing 
changes in the IOER EFFR spread between now and endMarch 2019, and between endMarch 
and endDecember 2019. Respondents assigned the highest importance to “Treasury 
securities supply dynamics” for the first period and to “change in the level of reserve 
balances”, and “Treasury securities supply dynamics” as a close second, for the second period.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 Policymakers may judge that the la bor market is operating appre ciably beyond full 
employment and that economic ac tivity—which is expanding at a f aster-than-
sustainable rate—will conti nue to be spurred by expansionary fi scal policy. 
o The unemployment rate is at its lowest level since the 1960s, i s below all 
estimates of the longer-run normal level of unemployment report ed in the 
September Summary of Economic Pro jections, and is projected to decline 
further.  Other indicators al so point to an already-tight labor market; these 
include a high rate of job openings , continued reports of firms  having 
difficulty hiring workers, and low levels of initial claims for  unemployment 
insurance. 
 Policymakers may predict that unwanted upward pressure on inflation is likely to 
emerge amid a prolonged period of significant labor market tigh tness.  Policymakers 
may point to the fact that averag e hourly earnings and the Empl oyment Cost Index 
rose 2.8 and 2.9 percent, respectiv ely, over the year ending in  September, among the 
highest 12-month increases since 2009, as evidence of incipient pressures on wage 
and price inflation.  They may als o point to reports that risin g input prices have been 
bolstered by strong demand or import tariffs as further evidenc e that inflation may 
rise above the Committee’s 2 percent objective for a sustained period.  
 Policymakers may judge that the eco nomy is stronger than previo usly expected.  
Payroll gains continue to indicate a tightening of the labor market, and the output gap is expected to further widen thi s year.  These developments may  suggest that the 
neutral federal funds rate is hi gher, and the current monetary policy stance is more 
accommodative, than previously estimated. 
 Despite eight increases in the t arget range for the federal fun ds rate between 
December 2015 and September 2018 and a net appreciation of the dollar, financial 
conditions have, by some measures, eased on balance since December 2015.  The spreads between rates on certai n investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds 
and rates on equivalent-maturit y Treasury securities remain sub stantially lower than 
in December 2015, even though the use of leverage by speculativ e grade and unrated 
firms has increased over the pe riod and equity prices have recently declined.  While 
the federal funds rate and key int erest rates for household and  business borrowers 
have increased over the past year, borrowing conditions have no t exhibited a

commensurate tightening, in part because of an easing in nonpri ce credit terms and 
standards.   
Policy Strategy 
 To keep inflation near 2 percent and sustain the economic expansion over the medium 
term, policymakers may judge that the target range for the fede ral funds rate will 
likely need to be raised to a highe r level than has been sugges ted by previous FOMC 
communications.  
o Policymakers may be concerned that ongoing above-trend economic  growth 
and an already-strong labor market that continues to tighten co uld soon result 
in more notable upward pressure on inflation. 
o They may also judge that the federal funds rate needs to be rai sed to prevent 
the unemployment rate from dec lining significantly further belo w its normal 
longer-run value; such a further  decline could make it increasi ngly 
challenging to engineer a soft landing as inflation picks up. 
o Additionally, amid still-elevate d asset valuations and high lev els of debt at 
risky firms, in order to avoid a significant buildup of financial imbalances, 
policymakers may see the need to s ignal that gradual rate incre ases will take 
the federal funds rate to a highe r level than has been previous ly communicated 
by the Committee.  
 Some policymakers may see it as li kely that the ta rget range for the federal funds rate 
will need to rise to levels that will restrict economic growth in order to reduce the risk 
that inflation will rise persistently above the Committee’s 2 p ercent objective or to 
reduce the risk of a build-up in f inancial imbalances.  They ma y want to communicate 
this outlook well in advance of po licy becoming modestly restri ctive. 
 For the above reasons, policymak ers may opt to increase the tar get range for the 
federal funds rate to 2¼ to 2½ per cent at this meeting and indi cate that “further 
gradual increase” are expected “for some time.”  
 Policymakers may also wish to communicate in paragraph 2 that “ The Committee is 
monitoring inflation developments  closely,” signaling concern about the inflation 
risks associated with hig h resource utilization. 
 Because financial market participants appear to regard the odds  of a rate hike at the 
upcoming meeting as negligible , the adoption of Alternative C w ould surely come as 
a surprise.  The unexpected incre ase in the target range for th e federal funds rate and

the new language regarding t he outlook for policy would likely cause policy 
expectations to ratchet up both i n the near term and farther ou t.  If, however, a 
statement along the lines of Altern ative C were issued after a meeting during which 
financial market participants had come to anticipate an increas e in the target range for 
the federal funds rate, near-t erm policy expectations might not  change much, while 
those farther ahead would likel y rise.  In either case, in resp onse to a statement like 
Alternative C, medium- and longer- term real interest rates coul d rise, equity prices 
and inflation compensation coul d fall, and the dollar could app reciate.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 Policymakers may see that inflation has moved close to 2 percent and that it is 
projected to remain close to tha t level on a sustained basis.  
 Moreover, policymakers may see li ttle evidence of labor market overheating.  
o Even as the unemployment rate  has ticked down since the beginni ng of the 
year, policymakers may see wage pressures as subdued.  While th e 12-month 
growth rates of average hourly e arnings and the employment cost index have 
edged up, so has productivity gro wth, keeping unit labor cost g rowth 
contained and indicating that the low level of the unemployment  rate is not 
likely to cause inflation to rise appreciably above 2 percent. 
 Policymakers may note that the hi gh growth rate of real GDP in the first three 
quarters of 2018 was associated w ith a number of upside surprises, and that real GDP 
growth is projected to decline steadily over the next few years , in part reflecting 
waning fiscal impetus. 
o Policymakers may judge that rising m ortgage interest rates have  contributed to 
recent weaker-than-expected indicators of housing demand. 
o Additionally, policymakers may see recent declines in equity pr ices as 
supporting their view that GDP grow th is likely to slow further . 
 Policymakers could judge that the current level of the federal funds rate lies within 
the confidence bands of a range of  estimates of the neutral lev el for the federal funds 
rate.  Furthermore, they may see developments in Treasury marke ts—particularly the 
flattening yield curve—as supporti ng the view that current poli cy is close to neutral. 
Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers may judge that both objectives of the dual mandate  are nearly fulfilled.  
They may determine it prudent t o leave the target range for the  federal funds rate 
unchanged for a while as they assess incoming information so as  not to undermine the 
expansion of economic activity a nd the sustained return of infl ation to 2 percent. 
o Policymakers may note that, while the expansion has been robust , the 
economy has shown few signs of overheating.  The labor market h as 
improved at a steady pace over th e past few years without generating a large

increase in either unit labor costs or inflation.  Moreover, in flation 
expectations have remaine d stable over this period.   
o Policymakers may also view substantial risks asso ciated with tightening too 
quickly or too much.  Such policy actions could undermine the e xpansion or 
cause inflation to run persistentl y below the Committee’s 2 per cent objective.  
An overly restrictive policy stanc e could be reflected in an in version of the 
yield curve, something that has in the past been associated wit h recessions.  
Furthermore, a slowdown in grow th abroad or trade policy develo pments 
could also restrain the econo my over the near term.   
o Policymakers might note that monetary policy affects economic a ctivity with 
a lag, and that the removal of accommodation that has taken pla ce over the 
past few years will continue to a ct as a restraint on economic growth for some 
time, mitigating the need for more increases in the target rang e for the federal 
funds rate at this stage.  Th ey may see soft readings on housin g demand as 
evidence that previous increases in the federal funds rate are already affecting 
the housing market.  Additionally, policymakers may note that, as the Federal 
Reserve’s asset holdings continue to decline, the downward pressure on 
longer-term yields those holdings induce will diminish. 
 Policymakers may continue to view t he current state of the financial system as sound 
and the potential for a buildup of r isks to financial stability as limited, or they may 
judge that interest rate policy is not an effective means of addressing any significant 
financial stability concerns that may emerge. 
 A statement along the lines of Alte rnative A would reduce expec tations of rate hikes 
in the near future. Such a statement could cause medium and longer-term interest 
rates to fall, while also leadi ng to a depreciation of the doll ar.  Equity prices and 
inflation compensation could rise.

rate, an implementation note th at indicates no change to the Fe deral Reserve’s 
administered rates—the interest rate on required and excess reserve balances, the offering 
rate on overnight reverse repurchase agreements, and the primar y credit rate—would be

Balance Sheet and Income Projections 
The staff has prepared projecti ons of the Federal Reserve’s bal ance sheet and 
elements of the associated incom e statement that are consistent  with the baseline 
economic outlook presented in Tealbook A.  Key features of thes e projections are 
described below.  
SOMA redemptions and reinvestments.   As reported in t he exhibit titled 
“Redemptions and Reinvestments of SOMA Principal Payments,” the  staff projects that 
the balance sheet normalization program initiated in October 20 17 will lead to the 
redemption of $229 billion of Treasury securities and about $15 2 billion of agency 
securities over 2018.  During this same period, reinvestments of principal payments on 
Treasury and agency securitie s are projected to be $197 billion  and $88 billion, 
respectively.  Under the staff’s current baseline forecast, no further reinvestments of 
agency securities are projected t o occur given the October 2018 increase in the cap on 
monthly redemptions of age ncy securities to $20 billion.1  However, the projections for 
agency securities are subject  to considerable uncertainty because unscheduled 
prepayments depend on factors that are difficult to predict, in cluding the realized path of 
mortgage rates.2 
Evolution of the size of the balance sheet.   One key assumption behind the 
balance sheet projection is that the longer-run level of reserv e balances will be 
$500 billion.3  Under the baseline assumptions , the staff currently projects that this level 
1 Future reinvestments of principal from maturing Treasury secur ities will take place primarily in 
the middle month of each quarter. 
2 If principal payments of agency  securities received were to bre ach the $20 billion monthly 
redemption cap before the size of the balance sheet is normaliz ed, then the Desk would reinvest in agency 
MBS the amount by which the prin cipal payments received during any month exceed the $20 billion 
redemption cap.  For further details, see the FOMC memo titled “Operational Readiness for MBS 
Reinvestments” (June 2018). 
3 Other noteworthy assumptions  about liability items underlying the projections are as follows:  
The Treasury General Account is a ssumed to increase in line wit h nominal GDP; Federal Reserve notes in 
circulation are assumed to incr ease at an average annual pace o f about 6 percent through 2020 and at the 
same pace as nominal GDP thereafter; the foreign repo pool and balances in the accounts of designated 
financial market utilities remain at their average September 20 18 levels of approximately $230 billion and 
$65 billion, respectively; and take-up at the overnight RRP fac ility is assumed to maintain its September

of reserve balances will be reached in the third quarter of 202 1, about one quarter later 
than in the September Tealbook projection.4  As of the end of September, reserve 
balances have declined by about $300 billion since the normaliz ation program began, and 
by about $1 trillion since the month-end peak of reserve balanc es was reached in August 
2014 (see the exhibit titled “Tota l Assets and Selected Balance  Sheet Items” and the table 
that follows the exhibit). 
From the start of the balance sheet reduction program in Octobe r 2017 to its 
projected conclusion at the time of normalization in 2021, the Federal Reserve’s 
securities holdings are predic ted to decline about $1.3 trillio n, with holdings of Treasury 
and agency securities shr inking about $800 billion and $500 billion, respectively.  When 
the size of the balance sheet i s normalized, the SOMA portfolio  is projected to be a touch 
less than $3 trillion, consisti ng of about $1.7 trillion in Treasury securities and $1.3 
trillion in agency securities.   
Once the declines in asset holdi ngs associated with normalizati on have taken 
place, the size of the balance sheet is projected to stand at roughly 13 percent of nominal 
GDP, compared with a peak of a bout 25 percent in 2014 and a pre -crisis average of about 
6 percent.  After the size of the  balance sheet is normalized, SOMA holdings will begin 
to rise, keeping pace with the inc reases in Federal Reserve lia bilities—including Federal 
Reserve notes in circulation and t he Treasury General Account ( TGA)—as well as 
Federal Reserve Bank capital.  Expressed as shares of nominal GDP, Federal Reserve 
assets and liabilities a re expected to edge down. 
Federal Reserve remittances.   Remittances to the Treasury are projected to 
decline to $63 billion this  year from $80 billion in 2017 (see the “Income Projections” 
exhibit).5  This decline primarily reflect s the realized and expected inc reases in the 
interest rate paid on reserve ba lances in 2018; total interest expense is projected to rise by 
4 Generally speaking, the size of  the balance sheet is considere d to be normalized when the 
resumption of purchases of Treas ury securities is required to s atisfy the demand for reserve balances and 
accommodate the expansion of key  non-reserve liability items. 
5 This estimate includes two mandated transfers to the Treasury due to reductions to the statutory 
limit on aggregate Reserve Bank  surplus.  First , $2.5 billion w as transferred in Fe bruary following an 
amendment to Section 7 of the Fed eral Reserve Act by the Bipart isan Budget Act of 2018, enacted in 
February 2018.  Second, $675 mill ion was transferred in June, r eflecting another amendment to Section 7 
by the Economic Growth, Regulato ry Relief, and Consumer Protect ion Act, enacted in May 2018.

$15 billion to $44 billion this year.6  In addition, the reduction in SOMA securities 
holdings this year results in a s light decrease in projected interest income to $112 billion.  
As interest expense on reserve ba lances increases with a higher  target range for the 
federal funds rate, and as interest income decreases with lower asset holdings, 
remittances are expected to decline further and to bottom out a t $33 billion in 2020.  
Thereafter, remittances increase due to both a decrease in inte rest expense as the target 
range for the federal funds rat e is projected to decline, and a n increase in interest income 
once the Desk resumes purchases of Treasury securities for the SOMA portfolio. 
The projected path for remittances over the next few years is s imilar to that in the 
September Tealbook.  As shown in t he bottom left panel of the “ Income Projections” 
exhibit, annual remittances average about 0.25 percent of nomin al GDP over the 
projection period, slightly higher than their pre-crisis averag e. 
Unrealized gains or losses.   The SOMA portfolio was  in a net unrealized loss 
position of about $66 billion at th e end of September.7  With longer-term interest rates 
expected to rise further over the next few years, the unrealize d loss position is expected to 
peak at $280 billion in 2020:Q1.  Of this amount, $119 billion is attributable to Treasury securities and $161 billion to age ncy MBS.  The unrealized loss position subsequently 
narrows, in large part because t he value of securities acquired  under the Federal 
Reserve’s large-scale asset pur chase programs returns to par as those securities approach 
maturity.  The net unrealized posi tion is projected to be a bit lower in the near term 
compared to the September Tealbook. 
Term premium effect.   As shown in the table “Pr ojections for the 10-Year 
Treasury Term Premium Effect,” SOMA securities held as a result  of the Federal 
Reserve’s asset purchase program s are currently estimated to be  reducing the term 
premium in the 10-year Treas ury yield by about 75 basis points,  the same as projected in 
6 We continue to assume that the FOMC will set a 25 -basis-point-wide target range for the federal 
funds rate throughout the projection period.  Consistent with t he September FOMC Implementation Note, 
we assume that the interest rates paid on reserve balances will  be set five basis points below the top of the 
target range for the federal fu nds rate. We continue to assume  that the offering rate on overnight RRPs will 
be set at the bottom of the range.

potential implications for the F ederal Reserve’s ability to meet its obligations, see Brian Bonis, Lauren

the previous Tealbook; this eff ect fades gradually over time.  The estimated path of the 
term premium effect depends on the  difference between the expected path of the Federal 
Reserve’s balance sheet over co ming years and a counterfactual projection based on the 
configuration of the balance shee t that prevailed before the financial crisis of 2007 2008.  
In this counterfactual projecti on it is assumed that reserve ba lances reach their longer-run 
level at $100 billion.   
SOMA characteristics.  As shown in the top panel of t he “Projections for the 
Characteristics of SOMA Treasury S ecurities Holdings” exhibit, the weighted-average 
duration of the SOMA Treasury port folio is currently about six years.  This measure is 
projected to increase over the co urse of balance sheet normaliz ation as redemptions 
continue and longer-duration securi ties become a larger share o f the portfolio.  In terms 
of the composition of the portfolio, the share of agency MBS is expected to peak at 44 
percent shortly before the size  of the balance sheet is expecte d to be normalized, 
reflecting the faster pace of ro ll-offs of Treasury securities, and then to decline to 30 
percent at the end of 2024. 
After normalization of the si ze of the balance sheet in 2021, t he duration of the 
SOMA Treasury portfolio is project ed to decline as the Desk beg ins adding securities to 
the SOMA portfolio to keep pace with the expansion in non-reser ve liabilities.  The 
initial sharp decline in duration results from the staff’s assu mption that the Desk will 
purchase only Treasury bills until these securities account for  one-third of the Federal 
Reserve’s Treasury securities po rtfolio, close to their pre-cri sis share.8  Thereafter, 
purchases of Treasury securities are assumed to be spread across the maturity spectrum 
(see the bottom panel of the exhi bit titled “Proj ections for th e Characteristics of SOMA 
Treasury Securities Holdings”).   
8 Excluding securities acquired through small-value test operati ons, the SOMA portfolio currently 
contains no Treasury bills.
