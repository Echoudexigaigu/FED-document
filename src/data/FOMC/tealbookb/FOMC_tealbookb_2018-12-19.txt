Information received since the Committee met in November indica tes that the 
labor market has continued to strengthen.  In November, the unemployment rate held 
steady at 3.7 percent and, despit e some slowing, the 3-month av erage of payroll gains, at 
170,000 per month, remained well above the pace necessary to ab sorb new entrants to the 
labor force.  Real GDP is proj ected to grow 3 percent over this  year.  The staff continues 
to expect above-trend real GDP growth through 2019 and high levels of resource 
utilization over the medium term.  The 12-month changes in headline and core PCE 
prices were 2 percent and 1.8 per cent, respectively, in October.  The staff projects that 
core PCE inflation will edge back up to 1.9 percent by year-end  and then run at 2 percent 
over the medium term.  Headline PCE inflation is projected to b e below core inflation 
through 2019, reflecting the recent large declines in oil price s, but to run in line with the 
core rate thereafter.  The sta ff has not significantly altered its outlook in light of the 
recent movements in financial market prices.      
Against this backdrop, the alternative policy statements presen ted below offer a 
range of options for the curre nt setting of policy and the expe cted path going forward.  
Alternative B is written with a  view that the economy has evolv ed roughly in line with 
the Committee’s expectations, thu s meriting another increase in  the target range for the 
federal funds rate at the December meeting.  To acknowledge tha t the extent of future 
policy tightening has likely diminished as the target range has  risen, and to indicate 
somewhat less conviction about t he expected path of the federal  funds rate, the draft of 
Alternative B modifies the forward guidance language in paragraph 2.  In particular, the draft states that the Committee “judges” that “some” further gr adual increases in the 
target range will be consistent with achieving the Committee’s goals.  Additionally, by 
making only modest changes to the  statement through the adoptio n of Alternative B, the 
Committee would communicate that the recent volatility in finan cial markets has not 
caused a significant shift in t he Committee’s outlook for the e conomy or monetary policy 
at this time.  
Alternative C is written from th e perspective that the incoming  data continue to be 
stronger than is sustainable a nd that, in order to contain even tual inflation risks, the 
FOMC should signal that the federal funds rate will likely need  to rise to a higher level 
than has been implied by previous communications.  Under this a lternative, the

Committee would raise the targe t range at this meeting and sign al that further gradual 
increases are likely to be warranted. 
Alternative A is motivated by an assessment that the current st ance of monetary 
policy, at this time, is appropria te to achieve the Committee’s  objectives, and that further 
gradual increases in the target range could unduly slow the eco nomic expansion and 
forestall the sustained return of inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective.  Under 
this alternative, the Committee w ould maintain the current targ et range for the federal 
funds rate and signal a pause in  the current tightening cycle.  
With regard to the specifics of the language in Alternatives A,  B, and C: 
 The assessment of the incoming data: 
o Alternatives A and B have very similar characterizations of the  incoming data, 
both of which are little changed fro m the November FOMC stateme nt.  While 
Alternative B again reports tha t both overall and core inflatio n “remain near 
2 percent,” Alternativ e A notes that both “have softened but re main near 
2 percent.” 
o Alternative C emphasizes that th e labor market “continued to ti ghten,” citing 
“robust” job gains and noting that “the unemployment rate is at  multi-decade 
lows.” 
 The outlook for economic activity  and inflation, the associated  risks, and the 
monetary policy path upon whic h the outlook is conditioned: 
o As in November, Alternative B projects “sustained expansion of economic 
activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near th e Committee’s 
symmetric 2 percent objective ove r the medium term,” and notes that risks to 
this outlook are “roughly balanced .”  These outcomes are achiev ed with 
“some further gradual increases” in the target range for the federal funds rate.  
o Alternative A offers the same  outlook for economic activity and  inflation as 
Alternative B.  However, under A lternative A, the Committee doe s not 
condition the economic outlook on “so me further gradual increas es” in the 
federal funds rate; instead, the Committee “judges that the cur rent target range 
for the federal funds rate at this time is consistent with” sus tained economic 
expansion and inflation near the C ommittee’s symmetric 2 percen t objective. 
Alternatives

o Alternative C also offers essent ially the same outlook for econ omic activity, 
the labor market, and inflation a s Alternative B, but states th at “further 
gradual increases” are “warrant ed” to achieve this outlook.  Additionally, 
Alternative C states that ri sks are “roughly balanced” only for  “economic 
activity,” thereby implying some  upside risk to the outlook for inflation. 
 The current policy decision a nd the outlook for policy: 
o Alternative B raises the target range t o 2¼ to 2½ percent.1  With the outlook 
conditioned on “some further gra dual increases,” such a stateme nt would 
acknowledge that the Committee anticipates slowing its pace of tightening 
after December. 
o Alternative A maintains the current target range.  By removing the reference 
to “further gradual increases”  and indicating that the Committe e judges that 
the current level of the federal  funds rate is appropriate “at this time,” such a 
statement would signal a  pause in raising rates.   
o Alternative C also raises th e target range by 25 basis points.  With “further 
gradual increases” i n the federal funds rate “warranted” to kee p inflation near 
the Committee’s objective and sustain the economic expansion, s uch a 
statement would signal that the  Committee judges that it will e ventually need 
to raise the federal funds rate to a higher level than has been  implied by its 
previous communications. 
 
   
                                                            
1 The implementation note associated with Alternatives B and C e mbeds the assumption that the 
Federal Reserve would make another technical realignment of the  interest rate paid on required and excess 
reserve balances relative to the  top of the target range for th e federal funds rate, bringing the spread to 
10 basis points.

NOVEMBER 2018  FOMC  STATEMENT  
1. Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in September 
indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and  that economic 
activity has been ris ing at a strong rate.  Job gains have been strong, on average, 
in recent months, and the unemplo yment rate has declined.  Hous ehold spending 
has continued to grow strongly, w hile growth of business fixed investment has 
moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year.  On a 12-month basis, both 
overall inflation and inflati on for items other than food and e nergy remain near 
2 percent.  Indicators of longer-te rm inflation expectations ar e little changed, on 
balance. 
 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that fur ther gradual 
increases in the target range f or the federal funds rate will be consistent with 
sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market c onditions, and 
inflation near the Committee’ s symmetric 2 percent objective ov er the medium 
term.  Risks to the economic  outlook appear roughly balanced. 
 
3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and in flation, the 
Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2 to 
2-1/4 percent.  
4. In determining the timing and size  of future adjustments to the  target range for the 
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expe cted economic 
conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 
2 percent inflation objective.  This assessment will take into account a wide range 
of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of 
inflation pressures and inflati on expectations, and readings on  financial and 
international developments.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
Economic Conditions and Outlook  
 Available data indicate that the  labor market has continued to strengthen. 
o Nonfarm payroll gains averag ed about 170,000 in the three month s ending in 
November, well above the pace that the staff projects is consis tent with no 
change in resour ce utilization. 
o The unemployment rate held steady at 3.7 percent in November, d own 
0.4 percentage point since the  end of 2017, and below all participants’ 
estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment in the September 
Summary of Economic Projections. 
o Average hourly earnings rose 3.1 percent over the year ending in November, 
consistent with a strong labor market.  
 The staff estimates that output  currently stands about 2¼ perce nt above its potential 
level, and anticipates that the output gap will widen to about 3 percent in 2020 before 
narrowing.  
 Inflation is projected to rema in close to the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent goal. 
o The 12-month change in headline PCE prices was  2 percent in October, while 
core PCE prices came in a little  below staff expectations at 1. 8 percent.   
o Despite its dip in October, the s taff projects core PCE inflation to remain close 
to 2 percent over the medium term.  While recent declines in oi l prices are 
expected to weigh on headline PC E inflation in early 2019, the effect of these 
declines on inflation is anticipat ed to be transitory and this measure is 
expected to return to 2 percent over the remainder of the mediu m term. 
o Against the backdrop of a pic kup in productivity growth, growth  in unit labor 
costs has remained modest. 
o Measures of inflation expectations continue to suggest that lon g-term inflation 
expectations remain well-anchor ed.  While market-based measures  of 
inflation compensation have decr eased somewhat, they have staye d within the 
range of readings over recent years.  Survey-based measures of longer-run 
inflation expectations  have remained steady.  
 Movements in asset prices indicat e that risk sentiment deterior ated somewhat further, 
on balance, since the November FOMC meeting.  Equity prices and Treasury yields

have declined, and yields and s preads on corporate bonds have i ncreased, particularly 
for speculative-grade debt.  Financial conditions for businesse s and households have 
tightened a bit, according to a r ange of indicators.  However, despite these recent 
developments, financial conditions continue to remain supportiv e of the economic 
expansion.     
 Risks to the outlook appear roughly balanced.  Upbeat household  and business 
sentiment, as reflected in recent readings, could combine with the ongoing boost from 
fiscal stimulus enacted last  year to cause spending and investm ent to expand faster 
than in the staff projection.  I n addition, sustained low level s of unemployment may 
give rise to greater inflation pressures than anticipated by the staff.  Conversely, a 
slowdown in foreign growth, advers e trade policy shocks, or sig nificant further 
tightening in financial conditions pose downside risks for econ omic activity.  
Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers may see an increase in the target range for the fe deral funds rate in 
December as consistent with ear lier communications indicating t hat further gradual 
increases in the target range would be appropriate if the econo my evolved about as 
anticipated.  
 Policymakers may also judge that “some” further gradual increas es in the target range 
will be appropriate in order to ba lance the risks associated wi th resource utilization 
becoming overly tight against  the risk of unduly slowing the ec onomy, potentially 
leading to below-t arget inflation.  
o Policymakers may view the reference to “some” further tightenin g as an 
acknowledgement that, with an inc rease in the target range in D ecember, they 
anticipate only relatively limited additional tightening. 
o Policymakers may also prefer to replace the word “expects” with  “judges” to 
communicate more clearly the C ommittee’s current level of conviction 
regarding the timing and size of future adjustments to the targ et range.   
 Policymakers may expect that inflation will continue to run clo se to the Committee’s 
symmetric 2 percent inflation goal as some further gradual tigh tening of monetary 
policy is carried out.  
o Policymakers may see an increase in the federal funds rate at t his meeting, 
along with some future gradual in creases in conjunction with on going

balance-sheet reduction, as containing the risk that inflation will rise 
appreciably above 2 percent. 
o Policymakers may also view the stability of longer-term inflati on expectations 
as consistent with achieving the Committee’s inflation objectiv e. 
 Market quotes along with responses t o the Desk’s latest surveys of primary dealers 
and market participants indicate t hat an increase in the target  range is seen as highly 
likely at the December meeting (see the box, “Monetary Policy E xpectations and 
Uncertainty”).  Survey respondent s have also noted policymakers ’ communications 
about potential changes to the  forward guidance language.  Cons equently, a statement 
along the lines of Alte rnative B seems unlikely to generate sub stantial changes in 
asset prices.

Monetary  Policy Expectations  and Uncertainty  
Market participants  appear to remain  confident that  the Committee  will 
announce  a 25‐basis‐point increase in the target range  for the federal  funds rate 
at the December  FOMC meeting.  In  contrast,  expectations  for the federal  funds 
rate beyond  2018 moved  down, suggesting  that investors  expect the federal 
funds rate to rise less quickly  and to a lower  level tha n at the  time of the 
November  meeting.  
A straight read of quotes on federal funds  futures contracts  implies that 
investors  attach about  85 percent odds to a 25‐ basis‐point increase in  the target 
range for the  federal funds  rate at  the upcoming  FOMC meeting (the left‐most 
blue bar in figure 1).   This probability  does not take into account the widely‐
expected  technical  adjustment  to the rate  of interest on  reserves  (IOR).  
Assuming  that the IOR rate will be raised by only 20 basis points at the December  
meeting,  these quotes  would instead imply that investors  are near certain of  a 25‐
basis‐point increase in  the target range (t he cumulative area covered  by the blue 
and red bars).1  Respondents  to the Desk’s December  surveys assigned,  on 
average, about 80 percent odds to a rate increase at  the upcoming  meeting.  
Expectations  for the federal funds  rate beyond  2018  have fallen over the  
intermeeting  period.  The market ‐implied probability  of a rate hike  at the March 
2019 FOMC meeting,  unadjusted  for term premiums,  has fallen from  70 percent 
to about 30 percent (figure  1).2  And the probability  distribution for the  level of 
the federal funds rate at the end  of 2019 implied by options quotes, also 
unadjusted  for term premiums,  has shifted to the left (figure 2), with the mean  of 
the distribution  falling from 2.9 to 2.6  percent.   The corresponding  average 
probability  distribution  from the December  Desk surv eys has also shifted lower 
(figure 3), albeit by less; the mean of the survey‐based distribution  fell from  2.8 to 
2.7 percent.   Survey respondents  now place the highest odds on two 25‐ basis‐
point rate increases  in 2019 (at the time of the November  surveys, respondents  
attached  roughly equal probability  to two or  three rate  hikes).  
Forward rates implied  by OIS quotes (the light‐ blue lines in figure 4) decreased  by 
30, 44, and 37 basis points on net at the end of 2019, 2020  and 2021, respectively.  
Under the assumption  of zero term premiums, these  market‐implied forward 
rates suggest that investors  expect the federal funds  rate to reach about  2.6 
percent at the end  of 2019 before falling a bit in 2020.  The expected  path of the 
federal funds  rate adjusted  for term premiums using  a staff term structure  model 
(the red lines in figure 4) has declined  by less and continues  to point to a higher  
1 About 90 percent of the respondents  who answered  the question in the Desk’s 
December  surveys expect the spread between  the top of the target range for the federal 
funds  rate and the IOR rate to widen from the current 5 basis points to 10 basis points 
following  the December  meeting. 
2 The probability  of a rate hike at the January  2019 FOMC meeting remains close to zero.

expected  path for the federal  funds rate, reaching  about 3 percent  by the end of 
2019 and gradually  rising in 2020. 
As shown in  figure 5, the most recent expected  path for the federal  funds rate 
implied by the staff  model (the  red line)  is roughly consistent  with the median of  
respondents’  modal projections  from the December  Desk surveys (the brown 
line) but now  lies somewhat  below the Committee’s  September  median SEP  
projections  (the dark blue dots) for the  end of 2019 and 2020.  The  survey‐implied 
mean path  (the golden squares)  continues  to lie noticeably  below the survey‐
implied modal path, sugges ting that survey respondents  perceive  the risks to the  
economic  outlook as skewed towards the downside. 
Figure 6 shows measures  of the longer‐run expected  federal funds  rate.  A 
straight read of forward rates  at longer  horizons implied by Treasury securities  
(the blue line) suggests  that investors’  current expectation for  the average  
federal funds  rate from  5 to 10 years ahead is about 3 percent,  about 35 basis 
points lower than  at the time of the November  meeting.   Adjusting  for term 
premiums using  various staff term structure models  (with the  light‐red region 
showing a range of  three such  model  estimates)  cont inues to suggest  that 5‐to‐
10‐year‐ ahead expectations  are above the unadjusted  forward rates, at between 
3.3 and 3.9 percent.   In contrast,  surveys of professional  forecasters  suggest that 
longer‐run expectations  remain close to the unadjusted  forward rates; the  
average longer‐run forecast  from the December  Blue Chip survey  (the yellow 
diamonds)  and the median forecast  from the latest Desk surveys  (the green 
diamonds)  were 3.1 and 2.9 percent,  respectively. 
The December  Desk surveys also asked several questions  pertaining to the  
average size and composition  of the Federal Reserve  System’s balance sheet in 
2025, assuming  the economy  would not move back to the effective  lower bound  
between now  and then.  The median of  respondents’  projections  for the level of  
reserve balances  in 2025 was  $1.1 trillion, about $350 b illion above the  median 
projection  reported  in the June survey,  when this  question  was last asked; this 
increase could  reflect the results of the Senior Financial  Officer Survey  that were 
published  in late November, and  the FOMC’s discussion of  its future 
implementation  framework  as reported  in the minutes of the November 
meeting.   In a new question,  respondents  were also asked to provide  their 
projection  for the lowest weekly level they  expected  reserve balances  to reach 
between now  and the end of 2025, assuming  the economy does not move back 
to the effective  lower bound.  The median respondent projected  that reserve  
balances will decline  to a trough  of $1 trillion, with 90  percent of the respondents  
who answered  the question projecting  a trough  between $500 billion  and $1.4 
trillion.  The  median respondent  projected  the fourth  quarter of 2020 as the most 
likely date when the  par value  of the domestic SOMA  portfolio will first  exhibit 
quarter‐over‐ quarter growth.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 Policymakers may judge that the la bor market is operating appre ciably beyond full 
employment and that economic ac tivity—which is expanding at a f aster-than-
sustainable rate—will conti nue to be spurred by expansionary fi scal policy. 
o The unemployment rate is at its lowest level since the 1960s, i s below all 
estimates of the longer-run normal level of unemployment report ed in the 
September Summary of Economic Pro jections, and is projected to decline 
slightly further.   
 Policymakers may predict that unwanted upward pressure on inflation is likely to 
emerge amid a prolonged period of significant labor market tigh tness.  This tightness 
is apparent through widespread r eports of shortages of qualifie d employees and 
evidence of supply constraint s in certain sectors.   
 Policymakers may judge that broader financial conditions contin ue to be 
accommodative relative to historical experience, and that finan cial imbalances, which 
are already present, may grow  larger.  Although the federal fun ds rate and key interest 
rates for household and business bo rrowers have increased, they  have risen from very 
low levels, and the increases have  occurred alongside some easi ng in non-price credit 
terms and standards.   
Policy Strategy 
 To keep inflation near 2 percent and sustain the economic expansion over the medium 
term, policymakers may judge that the target range for the fede ral funds rate will 
likely need to be raised to a highe r level than has been sugges ted by previous FOMC 
communications.  
o Policymakers may be focused on i ndicators of a strong labor mar ket, such as 
the employment-to-population ratio of prime-age workers, which at nearly 
80 percent has returned to lev els last seen in 2007.  They may be concerned 
that this labor market tightness, combined with ongoing above-t rend economic 
growth, could soon result in mor e notable upward pressure on in flation. 
o They may also see a need to prevent the unemployment rate from declining 
significantly further below its normal longer-run value.  Such a further decline 
could make it increasingly chall enging to engineer a soft landi ng should 
inflation pick up following a prol onged period of tight resourc e utilization.

 Policymakers may note that, even with a rate hike at their Dece mber meeting, the 
federal funds rate would still li e below prescrip tions from a w ide range of policy 
strategies—including those from  most of the simple policy rules  shown in the 
“Monetary Policy Strategies”  section of Tealbook A.  To the ext ent that these 
prescriptions have provided reason able characterizations of past Committee behavior, 
policymakers may believe that la rge, prolonged deviations from these prescriptions 
risk unmooring inflation expecta tions or exacerbating other imb alances.  
 In order to avoid a significant buildup of financial imbalances , policymakers may see 
the need to signal a higher end- point for the tightening cycle than has been previously 
communicated by the Committee. 
 For the above reasons, policymak ers may opt to increase the tar get range for the 
federal funds rate to 2¼ to 2½ per cent at this meeting and indi cate that “further 
gradual increases” are “warranted.”  
 Policymakers may also wish to communicate in paragraph 2 that r isks to the outlook 
appear roughly balanced specifi cally for the outlook for econom ic activity.  This 
could signal, by omission, policymak ers’ concern that risks to the outlook for 
inflation may not be balanced. 
 While financial market participants regard a rate hike at the u pcoming meeting as 
highly likely, the guidance contai ned in Alternative C would co me as a surprise and 
would likely cause policy expect ations to ratchet up next year and potentially farther 
out.  In response to a statement like Alternativ e C, near-term real interest rates would 
likely rise, equity prices and inf lation compensation could fal l, and the dollar could 
appreciate.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 Policymakers may see that, although inflation has softened recently, it remains close 
to 2 percent and that it is projected to remain near that level  on a sustained basis.  
 Moreover, policymakers may see li ttle evidence of labor market overheating.  
o Wage pressures remain subdued even as the unemployment rate has  moved 
down since the beginning of the  year.  Although measures of lab or 
compensation have firmed over the past two years, so has productivity 
growth.  As a result, growth of un it labor costs has been modes t, making it 
less likely that the low level  of the unemployment rate will le ad to inflation 
rising appreciably above 2 percent.  
 Policymakers may note that the hi gh growth rate of real GDP in the first three 
quarters of 2018 was associated w ith a number of temporary fact ors, and that real 
GDP growth is projected to declin e steadily over the next few y ears, in part reflecting 
waning fiscal impetus. 
 Policymakers may see developments in Treasury markets—particula rly the further 
flattening of the nominal yield curve—as supporting the view that the current level of 
the federal funds rate is clo se to its neutral level.   
 Policymakers may judge recent developments across broader financial markets to be 
evidence of nascent downside risk s to economic activity, which additional tightening 
of monetary policy would likely exacerbate.     
Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers may judge that both objectives of the dual mandate  are nearly fulfilled.  
They may deem it prudent to leave the target range for the fede ral funds rate 
unchanged “at this time” while they assess incoming information  so as not to 
undermine the expansion of economic activity and the sustained return of inflation to 
2 percent.  
o Policymakers may note that, while the expansion has been robust , the 
economy has shown few signs of overheating.  The labor market h as 
improved at a steady pace over th e past few years without gener ating a sizable 
increase in either unit labor cost growth or inflation.  Moreov er, inflation 
expectations have remaine d stable over this period.   
Alternatives
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
December 13, 2018

o Policymakers may also view substantial risks asso ciated with tightening too 
quickly or too much.  Such policy actions could undermine the e xpansion or 
cause inflation to run persistentl y below the Committee’s 2 per cent objective.  
A restrictive policy stance c ould be reflected in an inversion of the yield 
curve—a development that has historically been associated with recessions.  
Furthermore, a slowdown in grow th abroad or trade policy develo pments 
could also restrain the econom y over the near term.  Thus, they  may feel that 
only conditional on a flatter pat h of the policy rate are risks  to the outlook 
roughly balanced.   
o Policymakers might note that monetary policy affects economic a ctivity with 
a lag, and that the removal of accommodation that has taken pla ce over the 
past few years will continue to a ct as a restraint on economic growth for some 
time, mitigating the need for more increases in the target rang e for the federal 
funds rate at this stage.  Policymakers may believe that pausin g now could 
provide an opportunity to ascerta in with greater precision the stance of 
monetary policy. 
 Policymakers may continue to view t he current state of the financial system as sound 
and the potential for a signifi cant buildup of risks to financi al stability as limited, or 
they may judge that interest rat e policy is not an effective me ans of addressing any 
significant financial stability concerns that may emerge. 
 Financial market participants are broadly expecting a rate hike  at the upcoming 
meeting; against this backdrop, a doption of a statement such as  Alternative A would 
certainly be a surprise.  Expect ations for rate hikes in the ne ar future would fall, and 
medium- and longer-term interest rates could decline as well.  If investors viewed 
monetary policy as simply being more accommodative than previously expected, 
equity prices and inflation compe nsation could rise and the dollar could depreciate.  
Conversely, if market participan ts viewed the statement as sign aling a less optimistic 
economic outlook, equity prices and inflation compensation coul d fall.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTE 
If the Committee decides to maintain the current target range f or the federal funds 
rate, an implementation note th at indicates no change to the Fe deral Reserve’s 
administered rates—the interest rate on required and excess reserve balances, the offering 
rate on overnight reverse repurchase agreements, and the primar y credit rate—would be 
issued.  If the Committee decides to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, an 
implementation note that communicat es the changes the Federal R eserve decided to make 
in these three policy tools w ould be issued.  Draft implementat ion notes that correspond 
to these two cases appear on the following pages; the implementation note for the latter case assumes that a technical adj ustment to the setting of the interest rate on required and 
excess reserve balances would be  made at this meeting.  Struck- out text indicates

Balance Sheet and Income Projections 
Here we summarize projections of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and 
income statement that are cons istent with the baseline forecast  in Tealbook A.  The 
projections in this Tealbook are based on an assumption of a longer-run level of reserve 
balances of $1 trillion, compa red to an assumption of $500 bill ion in the November 
Tealbook.1,2  Staff projects that this revise d level of reserve balances wi ll be reached in 
the second quarter of 2020, about f ive quarters earlier than un der the previous baseline 
level.3 
Evolution of the SOMA Portfolio.   So far, the balance sheet normalization 
program initiated in October 2017 has led to the redemption of $199 billion of Treasury 
securities and $139 billion of agency securi ties through Octobe r 2018 (see the table in the 
exhibit, “Redemptions and Reinvestments of SOMA Principal Payme nts”).  During this 
same period, reinvestments of principal payments on Treasury an d agency securities were 
$195 billion and $152 billion, respect ively.  Over the next yea r, redemptions of Treasury 
securities and MBS are projec ted to total approximately $280 and $170 billion, 
respectively.4  All told, total redemptions a re predicted to be about $1 tril lion prior to 
1 Policymakers’ discussion at the November FOMC meeting suggeste d that many participants lean 
toward implementing policy in the  longer run in a regime of abu ndant excess reserves.  The $1 trillion 
figure represents a rough estimat e of the level of reserve bala nces in an abundant-excess-reserve regime 
and is based on the range of suc h forecasts provided by staff i n the FOMC memo titled “The Federal 
Reserve’s Long-Run Operating Re gime” (November 2018).  The figu re includes a buffer to accommodate 
volatility in autonomous factors th at affect the l evel of reser ves and in banks’ reserve demand, as well as a 
cushion to allow for potential frictions in the redistribution of reserves. 
2 Other unchanged noteworthy a ssumptions about liability items u nderlying the projections are as 
follows:  The Treasury General Account is assumed to increase i n line with nominal GDP; Federal Reserve 
notes in circulation are assumed to increase at an average annu al pace of about 6 perce nt through 2020 and 
at the same pace as nominal GDP t hereafter; the f oreign repo po ol and balances in the accounts of 
designated financial market utilities remain at their average O ctober 2018 levels of approximately 
$225 billion and $60 billion, respectively; and take-up at the overnight RRP facility is assumed to remain at 
its October 2018 average of abo ut $5 billion until reserve bala nces reach $1.5 trillion, at which point take-
up declines to zero over  the subsequent year. 
3 Generally speaking, the size of  the balance sheet normalizes w hen reserves fall to their longer-
run level and purchases of Treasury securities resume keeping p ace with the expansion of key non-reserve 
liability items. 
4 No further reinvestments of age ncy securities are projected to  occur and future reinvestments of 
principal from maturing Treasur y securities will take place pri marily in the middle m onth of each quarter 
(see the bottom panel in the exhibit, “Redemptions and Reinvest ments of SOMA Principal Payments”).  
However, the projectio ns for agency securities are subject to c onsiderable uncertainty because of 
unscheduled prepayments.

normalization, with Treasury and a gency securities comprising a bout $600 billion and 
$380 billion, respectively (see th e exhibit titled “Total Assets and Selected Balance Sheet 
Items” and the table that follows the exhibit).   
When the size of the balance sheet is normalized, the SOMA port folio is projected 
to be a touch less than $3.3 trillion, consisting of about $1.9  trillion in Treasury securities 
and $1.4 trillion in agency securiti es.  At that time, the size of the balance sheet is 
projected to stand at roughl y 16 percent of nominal GDP, with n on-reserve liabilities 
totaling 11 percent of nom inal GDP.  For comparison, the size o f the balance sheet as a 
share of nominal GDP peaked at about 25 percent in 2014 and averaged about 6 percent 
prior to the crisis.  After the size of the balance sheet is no rmalized, SOMA holdings will 
begin to rise, keeping pace with the increases in Federal Reser ve liabilities—including 
Federal Reserve notes in circul ation and the Treasury General A ccount (TGA)—as well 
as Federal Reserve Bank capital.   
The share of agency MBS in the por tfolio, which currently stand s at 42 percent, is 
expected to rise slightly in the near term, reflecting the faster pace of Treasury roll-offs.  
This share begins to decline once the size of the balance sheet  normalizes and reaches 
25 percent at the end of 2024. 
SOMA portfolio characteristics.   The weighted-average  duration of the SOMA 
Treasury portfolio is currently a bout six years (see the top pa nel of the exhibit titled 
“Projections for the Character istics of SOMA Treasury Securities Holdings”).  This 
measure is projected to increas e until mid-2020 as redemptions continue and longer-
duration securities become a lar ger share of the portfolio.  Af ter normalization of the size 
of the balance sheet in 2020, the  duration of the SOMA Treasury  portfolio is projected to 
decline as the Desk adds Treas ury bills to the portfolio when n on-reserve liabilities grow 
and securities mature.5  Once Treasury bills are one-third of the Federal Reserve’s 
Treasury securities po rtfolio, close to their pre-crisis share, further purchases of Treasury 
securities are assumed to be spread  across the maturity spectru m (see the bottom panel of 
the exhibit).6  
5 The FOMC memo titled “SOMA Po rtfolio Composition” (December 20 18) explores two 
alternative Treasury compositions.  
6 Excluding securities acquired through small-value test operati ons, the SOMA portfolio currently 
contains no Treasury bills.

Federal Reserve remittances.   Remittances to the Treasury are projected to 
decline to $65 billion this  year from $81 billion in 2017, prim arily reflecting the increases 
in the interest rate paid on res erve balances in 2018 (see the “Income Projections” 
exhibit).7  Total interest expense is projected to rise by $14 billion, t o $43 billion, this 
year.8  In addition, the reduction in SOMA securities holdings this year results in a slight 
decrease in projected inter est income to $112 billion.  A similar pattern holds going 
forward.  Remittances are expected to decline further and to bo ttom out at $37 billion in 
2020.  Thereafter, remittances rise due to an increase in inter est income associated with a 
growing balance sheet.  The projected path for remittances is s imilar to that in the 
November Tealbook.  As shown in the  bottom left panel of the “Income Projections” 
exhibit, annual remittances average about 0.25 percent of nomin al GDP over the 
projection period, slightly higher than their pre-crisis averag e. 
Unrealized gains or losses.   The SOMA portfolio was  in a net unrealized loss 
position of about $105 billion at the end of October.9  With longer-term interest rates 
expected to rise further over the next few years, the unrealize d loss position is expected to 
peak at $241 billion in 2020:Q2.  Of this amount, $100 billion is attributable to Treasury 
securities and $141 billion to age ncy MBS.  The unrealized loss position subsequently 
narrows, as securities acquired unde r the Federal Reserve’s lar ge-scale asset purchase 
programs approach maturity.  The  net unrealized loss position is projected to be a bit 
smaller in the near term comp ared to the November Tealbook.  
Term premium effect.   SOMA securities held as a resu lt of the Federal Reserve’s 
asset purchase programs are curre ntly estimated to be reducing the term premium in the 
10-year Treasury yield by about 78 basis points (see the table,  “Projections for the 10-
7 This estimate includes two mandated transfers to the Treasury due to reductions to the statutory 
limit on aggregate Reserve Bank  surplus.  First , $2.5 billion w as transferred in February 2018 following an 
amendment to Section 7 of the Fed eral Reserve Act by the Bipart isan Budget Act of 2 018, enacted in that 
month.  Second, $675 million was tr ansferred in June 2018, refl ecting another amendment to Section 7 by 
the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection  Act, enacted i n May 2018.  
8 We continue to assume that the FOMC will set a 25 -basis-point-wide target range for the federal 
funds rate throughout the projection period.  Consistent with t he FOMC’s November Implementation Note, 
we assume that the interest rates paid on reserve balances will  be set five basis points below the top of the 
target range.  We continue to assume that the offering rate on overnight RRPs will be set at the bottom of 
the range.  
9 See the Tealbook B box titled “W hat Does it Mean for the SOMA Portfolio to Be in an 
‘Unrealized Loss’ Position?” (Jun e 2018) for an explanation of the accounting notions  of unrealized and 
realized gain and loss positions , as well as their implications  for the Federal Reserve’s ability to meet its 
obligations.

 Year Treasury Term Premium Eff ect”).  This term premium effect (or TPE) is a few basis 
points larger than projected i n the previous Tealbook, with the  difference between the 
current and previous estimates  growing to about 10 basis points by 2022.10  The 
difference between the two path s is due to the $500 billion inc rease in the assumed 
longer-run level of reserves, w hich, in turn, leads to a larger  balance sheet.   
In comparison to estimates for  the TPE of a $500 billion large- scale asset 
purchase (LSAP) at the time of the last round of such purchases in 2012, the magnitude 
of the change in the TPE path fro m the larger balance sheet is smaller.  There are three 
factors affecting the TPE compared with previous staff analyses :  First, the effect of a 
given dollar amount of securities holdings is scaled by nominal  GDP, and nominal GDP 
is now larger.  Second, the LSAPs t argeted long-duration assets  only; this projection 
assumes that the additional SOMA  assets are aligned more closely with the pre-crisis 
distribution of asset holdings.  Taken together, these two fact ors imply that the TPE of 
the change in the longer-run res erves assumption should be abou t one-third the size of the 
effect of a similarly-sized LSA P in 2012.  A third factor works  in the opposite direction:  
Whereas the securities acquired with the LSAPs were assumed to run off, the additional 
portfolio holdings associated with  the increased reserves assum ption are permanent, 
which strengthens the effect of t he change in the reserves assu mption.  All told, the 
increase in the assumption for the longer-run level of reserves is estimated to increase the TPE by about one-half of a similarly-sized LSAP in 2012.   
                                                 
10 The estimated path of the TPE d epends on the difference betwee n the expected path of the 
Federal Reserve’s balance sheet over coming years and a counterfactual projection based on the 
configuration of the balance sheet that prevailed before the fi nancial crisis of 2007-2008.  In the 
counterfactual projection, it is  assumed that reserve balances reach their longer-run level at $100 billion.
