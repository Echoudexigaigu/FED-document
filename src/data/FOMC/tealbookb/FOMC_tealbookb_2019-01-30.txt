Despite the volatility in financ ial markets in recent months, information received 
since the Committee met in Decembe r indicates that real activit y continued to increase at 
a solid pace through the end of last year and that the labor ma rket has continued to 
strengthen.  The staff estimate s that real GDP rose at an annua l pace of 2.8 percent in the 
fourth quarter of 2018, led by str ong household spending and a pickup in business fixed 
investment.  Job growth remaine d robust in the fourth quarter, with payrolls expanding at 
an average monthly pace of about 250,000.  The unemployment rate edged up to 
3.9 percent in December, but this rise was accompanied by an in crease in the labor force 
participation rate.  The staff continues to project above-trend  real GDP growth through 
2019 and high levels of resource util ization over the medium te rm.  Over the 12-months 
ending in December, the staff estimates that total and core PCE  prices increased 
1.7 percent and 1.9 percent, respec tively.  The staff continues to project that core PCE 
inflation will run near 2 percent  over the medium term, while t otal PCE inflation is 
expected to run below core inf lation in the near term, due to r ecent energy price declines, 
but to move back in line with it  over the medium term.  Although TIPS-based measures 
of inflation compensation have moved down noticeably in recent months, survey-based 
measures of longer-run inflati on expectations have changed litt le.  
Against this backdrop, the alternative policy statements presen ted below offer a 
range of options for communicating about the lik ely future path  of monetary policy.  The 
draft of Alternative B is substantially revised from the Decemb er 2018 statement and is 
consistent with the general shif t in policymakers’ communicatio ns over the intermeeting 
period.  Regarding the economic ou tlook, Alternative B affirms that the most likely 
outcome remains one of solid growth, strong labor market condit ions, and inf lation close 
to the 2 percent objective.  Howev er, in light of the tightening in financial conditions over 
recent months and concerns about a slowdown in global growth, A lternative B 
emphasizes a flexible and data-d ependent approach to monetary p olicy decisions.  In 
particular, Alternative B repla ces the reference to “some furth er gradual increases” in the 
federal funds rate with the sta tement that “the Committee will be patient as it determines 
what future adjustments to the target range for t he federal fun ds rate may be appropriate” 
to support the Committee’s continued outlook for “sustained exp ansion of economic 
activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near th e Committee’s symmetric    
2 percent objective.”

Another key change in Alternativ e B is the deletion of the sent ence on the balance 
of risks.  In the current environment, the inclusion of such a sentence may convey a 
stronger signal about the futur e course of monetary policy than the Committee may wish 
to send at a time when the new draft language emphasizes that t he Committee will be 
patient in assessing the implications for policy of recent glob al and financial 
developments. 
Alternative A is broadly similar to Alternative B.  The key dif ference is that 
Alternative A indicates that “the Committee judges that the ris ks to the economic outlook 
are tilted to the downside.”  T his addition gives more weight t o the likelihood that an 
easing in the stance of policy m ay soon become appropriate.  Alternative A states that the 
Committee “will be patient as it determines what, if any, adjus tments to the target range” 
may be appropriate to achieve its  objectives, suggesting more strongly than Alternative B 
that the federal funds rate may have reached the peak of the cu rrent cycle. 
Alternative C is written from the perspective that global econo mic and financial 
developments do not justify a mater ial change in the policy out look since last year.  
Accordingly, the draft adheres closely to the December postmeet ing statement.  It also 
conveys, in the first paragra ph, a somewhat more upbeat assessm ent of the incoming 
data. 
With regard to the specifics of the language in Alternatives A,  B, and C: 
 The assessment of the incoming data: 
o Alternatives A and B share the s ame characterizations of the in coming data, 
both of which are similar to the D ecember FOMC statement.  Both  
alternatives acknowledge the si zable declines in market-based m easures of 
inflation compensation that occu rred in recent months, but note that survey 
measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little chang ed.  
o Alternative C offers a slightl y stronger charact erization of th e incoming data, 
citing “robust” job gains, and no ting that “business fixed inve stment appears 
to have picked up.”  This alterna tive also retains the previous  language that 
“indicators of longer-term infla tion expectations are little ch anged.” 
 The outlook for economic activity  and inflation, the associated  risks, and the 
monetary policy path upon whic h the outlook is conditioned: 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

o Alternatives A and B note that t he Committee “continues to view  sustained 
expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions,  and inflation 
near the Committee’s symmetric  2 percent objective as the most likely 
outcomes.”  Both alternatives m ention “global economic and fina ncial 
developments and muted inflation p ressures” as factors altering  the outlook 
for policy.   
o Alternative B states that the Committee “will be patient as it determines what 
future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds ra te may be 
appropriate” to support th e Committee’s outlook.  
o Alternative A adds that the Co mmittee “judges that the risks to  the economic 
outlook are tilted to the downside,” and that the Committee will be patient as 
it determines “what, if any, adjustments” to the target range m ay support its 
objectives.  
o Alternative C projects “sustain ed expansion of economic activit y, strong labor 
market conditions, and inflation ne ar the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent 
objective over the medium term,”  and notes that ri sks to this o utlook are 
“roughly balanced.”  These outcomes will likely be achieved with “some further gradual increases” in the  target range for the federal funds rate. 
 The current policy decision a nd the outlook for policy: 
o All three alternatives maintain t he current target range for th e federal funds 
rate at this meeting. 
o Alternatives A and B now report the target range decision in pa ragraph 2 
before turning to the outlook for  the economy and policy.  Alternative C, as 
noted above, adheres closely to the December statement and thus  reports the 
target range decision in paragraph 3. 
o Unlike Alternatives A and B, Altern ative C retain s the judgemen t that “some 
further gradual increases” in the federal funds rate will be ap propriate.

DECEMBER 2018  FOMC  STATEMENT  
1. Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in November 
indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and  that economic 
activity has been ris ing at a strong rate.  Job gains have been strong, on average, 
in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low.  Household 
spending has continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed 
investment has moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the yea r.  On a 12-month 
basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other tha n food and energy 
remain near 2 percent.  Indicator s of longer-term  inflation exp ectations are little 
changed, on balance. 
 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum 
employment and price stability.  T he Committee judges that some  further gradual 
increases in the target range f or the federal funds rate will be consistent with 
sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market c onditions, and 
inflation near the Committee’ s symmetric 2 percent objective ov er the medium 
term.  The Committee judges that risks to the economic outlook are roughly 
balanced, but will continue to monitor global economic and fina ncial 
developments and assess their implications for the economic out look. 
 
3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and in flation, the 
Committee decided to rai se the target range for the federal fun ds rate to 2-1/4 to 
2-1/2 percent. 
 
4. In determining the timing and size  of future adjustments to the  target range for the 
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expe cted economic 
conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its  symmetric         
2 percent inflation objective.  This assessment will take into account a wide range 
of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of 
inflation pressures and inflati on expectations, and readings on  financial and 
international developments.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
Economic Conditions and Outlook  
 Although incoming data for the labor market and the real econom y have been strong 
and inflation has remained close  to 2 percent, a number of the factors that propelled 
growth in 2018 appear to be wan ing.  Risky asset prices have de clined and financial 
conditions have tightened, on net, s ince last September amid in creased concerns 
about the domestic and global ec onomic outlook.  While asset va luations have 
partially recovered since the ye ar end, the tightening in finan cial conditions and less 
buoyant economic conditions abroad are headwinds for the U.S. o utlook.  These 
factors, along with w aning fiscal stimulus and the cumulative e ffects of previous 
reductions in monetary polic y accommodation, should contribute to a step-down in 
growth this year.  Despite high l evels of resour ce utilization,  inflationary pressures 
continue to be subdued. 
 Available data indicate that the  labor market has continued to strengthen. 
o Nonfarm payroll gains averag ed about 250,000 in the three month s ending in 
December, well above the pace that the staff estimates is consi stent with no 
change in resour ce utilization. 
o The unemployment rate rose slightly to 3.9 percent in December,  but this rise 
was accompanied by an increase in labor force participation.  T he 
unemployment rate is down 0.2 per centage point since the end of  2017, and 
although it remains below all participants’ estimates of the longer-run rate of 
unemployment in the December Summary of Economic Projections, 
policymakers do not expect high le vels of labor u tilization to generate notable 
upward pressure on inflation. 
o Average hourly earnings rose 3.2 percent over the year ending i n December, 
consistent with a strong labor market.  
 Inflation is projected to rema in close to the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent goal. 
o The staff expects the change i n total and core PCE prices to be 1.7 percent and 
1.9 percent, over the twelve mont hs ending in December.  While core inflation 
came in notably below 2 percent  over the six months ending in N ovember, at 
an annual rate of 1.5 percent, the s taff attributes some of thi s shortfall to 
residual seasonalit y and projects core PCE inflation to bounce back and 
remain close to 2 percent on a 12-month basis.  Recent declines  in oil prices

are expected to weigh on total PCE inflation in the near term, but the effect of 
these declines on inflation is anticipated to be transitory and  this measure is 
expected to return to 2 percen t over the medium term. 
o Despite some increases in wage growth, unit labor costs have de celerated as 
productivity growth has picked up. 
o The decline in market-based measures of inflation compensation that occurred 
in the fall has persisted, leav ing the level of inflation compe nsation 
5-to-10 years ahead about 30 basis points lower than in October.  Staff models 
attribute more of this decline t o reduced risk premiums rather than to lower 
expected inflation.1  Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation 
expectations have changed little and remain within the range of  readings over 
recent years.  On balance, measures of inflation expectations c ontinue to 
suggest that longer-term inflati on expectations remain well-anc hored.   
 Financial market participants’ a ppetite for risk d eteriorated m arkedly late last year, 
with enhanced sensitivity to changing perceptions of the future  path of monetary 
policy and the growth outlook.  O ver the fourth quarter of 2018, equity prices fell 
sharply and risk spreads on corporate bonds widened.  Meanwhile , Treasury yields 
declined notably and financial c onditions for businesses and ho useholds tightened, 
according to a range of indicator s.  That said, over the interm eeting period alone, 
changes in U.S. risk asset pr ices were positive, on net. 
 Risks appear to be shifting somewhat to the downside. 
o Household and business sentiment, while broadly consistent with  solid growth 
and strong labor market outcomes, ha ve softened in recent month s.  The 
apparent slowdown in foreign gr owth, continuing trade policy di sputes, the 
prospect of significant further tightening in financial conditions, and, to a 
lesser extent, waning fiscal impet us pose downside risks for economic 
activity. 
Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers may continue to see economic conditions evolving i n line with their 
expectations as the most lik ely outcome, but in light of the four increases in the target 
range in 2018 and the tightening of financial conditions in rec ent months, they may

deem it prudent to leave the ta rget range unchanged at the Janu ary meeting and to 
cease signaling that further increases in the target range are likely. 
By adopting Alternative B, policymakers would acknowledge that with softer global
economic and financial conditions and muted inflation pressures , it is advisable for
the Committee to exercise patien ce, while awaiting the arrival of data that can inform
its judgment about the appropriate  stance of monetary policy.
At the same time, policymakers may prefer to withhold an explic it characterization of
the balance of risks to avoid conveying too strong a signal abo ut the future course of
monetary policy.
Policymakers may expect that inflation will continue to run clo se to the Committee’s
symmetric 2 percent inflation goa l over the medium term.  Howev er, policymakers
may judge that, with muted inflati on pressures, further increas es in the federal funds
rate could result in inflation running persistently below the 2  percent objective.
Market quotes along with responses t o the Desk’s latest surveys of primary dealers
and market participants indicate t hat an increase in the target  range at either the
January or March meetings is s een as highly unli kely.  Alternat ive B appears to be
largely consistent with the tone of policymakers’ communication s over the
intermeeting period and with subseq uent market adjustments to t he expected path of
the policy rate.  However, results  from the Desk’s surveys sugg est that some market
participants could be surprise d by the extent of revisions to t he statement, including
the removal of “some further gra dual increases.”  Consequently,  a statement along the
lines of Alternative B could lead  to modest declines in market expectations for the
federal funds rate and some increases in equity prices and inflation compensation.That said, in the current envir onment of heightened sensitivity  to policy
communications, predicting the mar ket reaction is particular un certain at this meeting.

Monetary  Policy Expectations  and Uncertainty  
Despite declining  substantially  early in the intermeeting  period, measures  of 
federal funds  rate expectations  for the next  few years  based on financial market 
prices ended the period only slightly lower.  However,  respondents  to the Desk’s 
January surveys have  pushed back the most likely timing of further rate hikes  in 
2019 and moderately  revised down  thei r federal funds  rate expectations  for 202 0. 
Quotes on federal funds futures contracts  imply that investors  attach virtually  no 
odds to a 25‐ basis‐point increase in  the target range for the federal  funds rate at 
the January FOMC meeting (not shown).  Looking  further ahead, the probability  
distribution  for the federal  funds rate at  the end of 2019 implied by options 
quotes changed  little, on net (figure 
1); a straight read  of the distribution  
suggests that investors  continue  to place roughly equal odds on either no change 
to the target range for the  federal funds  rate or one 25‐basis‐point increase in  
2019.  
Financial market measures  of the expected  federal funds  rate over  the next few
 
years varied significantly  over the  intermeeting  period but ended  the period only 
slightly lower on net.  Early in the period, a deterioration  in investors’  risk 
sentiment  prompted  substantial  declines in forward  rates derived from  overnight 
index swaps (OIS) quotes; at one point, end‐2019 and end‐2020 
forward rates  had 
declined by 29 and 41 basis points, respectively  (the dash‐dotted blue line in 
figure 2).  But risk sentiment  subsequently  rebounded,  in part because of some 
robust data releases and comments  from FOMC parti cipants that were 
interpreted  as signaling  greater flexibility  in the 
conduct of monetary  policy in 
response  to adverse  developments.   On net, end‐2019 and end‐2020 forward 
rates ended the period only 5 and 8 basis points lower, respectively  (the solid 
blue line).  Movements  in the expected  federal funds  rate path adju sted for term 
premiums using  a staff term 
structure  model were  more muted (the red lines). 
Figure 3 compares  the current level of  various measures  of the expected  federal 
funds rate.  A straight  read of OIS forward  rates suggests that  investors  expect 
the federal funds rate to remain  unchanged  during 2019 and to decline  about 15 
basis points in 2020.  In contrast,  the latest path from the staff’s model continues  
to suggest  that investors  expect two  
25‐basis‐point rate increases  by the end of 
2019 and further gradual increases  thereafter, which  is close to the Committee’s  
December  median  SEP projections  (the dark blue dots).  The modal path  
reported  by the median re spondent to the  Desk’s January surveys similarly 
points 
to two further  rate hikes  in 2019 (the brown line),1 although  the most likely timing 
of those hikes has  been pushed  back from the first and third quarters  of 2019 in 
1 The staff model incorporates  survey forecasts  for the federal funds rate from Blue Chip 
Financial Forecasts,  which generally  lie fairly close  to the modal path from the most recent 
Desk surveys.  The  model and surveys are therefore  not independent  sources  of information.

the December  surveys (not shown), to the second and fourth quarters  in the 
January surveys.  The survey ‐based modal path  at end‐2020 has fallen by  25 basis 
points since December, and  the path now points to no rate increases  after 2019. 
Figure 4 shows measures  of the longer‐run expected  federal funds  rate.  A 
straight read of forward rates  at longer  horizons implied by Treasury securities  
(the blue line) suggests  that investors’  current 
expectation for the average  
federal funds  rate 5 to 10 years  ahead is about 2.9 percent,  just slightly below its 
level at the  time of the December  meeting.   Adjusting  for term premiums using  
various staff term structure  models (with the  light‐ red‐shaded region showing  a 
range of thre e such model estimates)  continues  to 
suggest that 5‐to‐ 10‐year‐
ahead expectations  are above the unadjusted  forward rates, at between 3.1  and 
3.9 percent.2  In contrast,  surveys of  professional  forecasters  suggest that longer‐

run forecast  from the December  Blue Chip  survey (the yellow diamonds)  and the 
median forecast  from the latest Desk surveys  (the green diamonds)  were 3.1 and 
2.8 percent,  respectively. 
The January  Desk surveys asked respondents  for their  estimates   of the current 
and future levels of the neutral real federal funds  rate.  Figure 5 shows the 
dispersion  of responses  at different horizons.   Each dot  is centered  on a different 
projected  rate and is scaled in size by the number of respondents  making that 
projection.   The median estimate of  the current neutr
al rate was  0.60 percent,  
0.10 percentage point higher  than in the July/August  2018 survey, when this  
question was last asked. The median estimate for the  end of 2019 was little 
changed at 0.75 percent,  while the end‐2020 estimate declined  by 0.20 
percentage  point to 0.80  percent.   The median
 estimate for the end  of 2021, 
which was asked for the  first time in the January surveys, was 0.75 percent.  
A new question  in the January Desk surveys asked respondents  for their 
projections  of the level of the par value  of the SOMA portfolio at the  end of 2019, 
conditional  on different  
levels for the target  federal funds  rate at year ‐end.  
Figure 6 shows the medians  and interquartile  ranges of the individual  responses.   
If the federal funds  rate ends  the year at or  above its  current level, the  median 
respondent expects  the level of the SOMA portfolio to decline  from its current 
level of about $3.9 trillion ( shown by  the dotted line)  to 
about $3.4 trillion by year 
end.  However, if  the federal funds  rate ends the  year below its current level, the  
median respondent  expects the SOMA portfolio  to decline  by less: to $3.6 billion 
or $3.7 billion dollars if the federal funds  rate ends the  year between  1.76 percent  
and 2.25 percent  or below 1.76 percent,  respectively.  
2 Versions of this chart  shown in previous editions of this box reported  a range of

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
Policymakers may view slowing global economic growth and the re duced risk
appetite in financial markets as evidence that the balance of r isks for the outlook has
shifted to the downside.
Policymakers may also note that the strong growth rate of real GDP in 2018 was
associated with a number of tempor ary factors, and that real GDP growth is projected
to decline steadily over the next few years, in part reflecting  waning fiscal impetus.
oPolicymakers may also point to the recent softening of household and
business sentiment, the deterio ration of readings in most regio nal
manufacturing surveys, and the ongoing sluggishness in resident ial
construction as factors that could hold down economic growth in  the near
term.
Policymakers may observe that, w hile real growth has been robus t recently, the
economy has shown no signs of widespread overheating.  The labo r m
arket has
improved at a steady pace over th e past few years without gener ating a sizable
increase in either growth in un it labor costs or inflation.
oAlthough measures of labor compensation have firmed over the pa st two
years, so has productivity growth.  As a result, growth of unit labor costs has
been modest, making it less likel y that the low level of the un employment rate
will lead to inflation risi ng appreciably above 2 percent.
oLabor force participa tion has increased steadily since last Sep tember, notably
exceeding staff’s projections.
Policymakers may note that core PCE prices rose at an annual ra te of only 1.5 percent
in the second half of 2018 and may  have doubts that inflation will bounce back
promptly.  Policymakers may judge that some survey measures of inflation
expectations remain too low, a nd may also point to the persiste nt decline in market-
based measures of inflation compe nsation since la st October as evidence that longer-
term inflation expectatio ns may be softening.
Policymakers may see developments in Treasury markets—particula rly the flattening
of the nominal yield curve—as suppo rting the view that the curr ent level of the
federal funds rate is close to its neutral level.  Policymakers may also note that aninversion of the yield curve has  historically been associated w ith recessions.

Policy Strategy 
Policymakers may judge that while both objectives of the dual m andate are nearly
fulfilled at present, risks to the outlook are tilted to the do wnside.  They might also
note that inflation pressures ar e still muted, reducing any nee d for near-term policy
tightening.  They may therefore  deem it prudent to leave the ta rget range for the
federal funds rate unchanged a t this meeting and to signal an i ntention to be patient in
assessing what, if any, adjustmen ts in the target range may be appropriate to promote
the Committee’s objectives.
oPolicymakers may wish to adopt a f lexible approach to adjusting  the monetary
policy stance to sustain economic activity in the face of incre ased headwinds
to growth and to prevent further softening of inflation below t he Committee’s
2 percent objective.
oPolicymakers might note that monetary policy affects economic a ctivity with
a lag, and that the removal of accommodation that has taken pla ce over the
past few years will continue to r estrain economic activity for some time.
oBy referring explicitly to downside risks, policymakers might wish to suggest
that lower settings for the targe t range for the federal funds rate may soon
become appropriate.
Policymakers may continue to view t he current state of the fina ncial system as sound
and the potential for a signifi cant buildup of risks to financi al stability as limited.
However, policymakers may be concerned that a slowdown in growt h, even if
generally expected, may lead to a further tightening of financi al conditions,
particularly if firms’ credit ratings are downgraded or earning s fall short of
expectations.  Such developments  could further weaken the econo mic outlook.
Although Alternative A would be consistent with the widely-held  expectation of no
change in the target range at the upcoming mee ting, if market participants viewed the
explicit reference to risks being tilted to the downside as signaling pessimism on thepart of the Committee regardi ng the economic outlook, market ex pectations for the
federal funds rate would likely fall, together with equity pric es, the exchange value of
the dollar, and inflation compen sation.  However, to the extent  that market
participants judged Alternative A as confirming a more accommod ative policy
reaction function, then equity pri ces, and inflation compensation would likely rise,
while market expectations for the federal funds rate would fall .

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 Policymakers may judge that the labor market is operating beyon d full employment 
and that economic activity will continue to be spurred by expan sionary fiscal policy, 
still-buoyant levels of consumer  and business confidence and th e associated 
momentum in the economy. 
o The unemployment rate is below the estimates of a ll participant s of the 
longer-run normal level of unemp loyment reported in the December Summary 
of Economic Projections, and it is  projected to d ecline slightl y further. 
 Policymakers may note that incoming data on core PCE inflation have for some time 
been close to 2 percent, and may predict that upward pressure o n inflation could 
emerge amid a prolonged period of significant labor market tigh tness.  Policymakers 
may judge that inflation expect ations are little changed, and n ote that survey 
measures of longer-run inflation e xpectations have remained ste ady. 
 Policymakers may take positive signals, on net, from incoming d ata for the economic 
outlook, which have surprised sta ff to the upside.  In particul ar, they may note 
indications of a rebound in the gro wth rate of business fixed i nvestment from the 
moderate pace recorded in the third quarter.  Additionally, gro wth in household 
spending continues to be strong. 
 Policymakers may judge that the  decline in equity prices and th e upward move in 
corporate risk spreads since last  September are a healthy corre ction of excess 
valuation pressures.  They may f urther note that the decline in risk asset prices that 
occurred late last year has a lready partly retraced, and that i ncreases in market 
volatility have largely subsided.  More generally, policymakers  may view broader 
financial conditions as still accommodative, relative to historical experience. 
Policy Strategy 
 To keep inflation near 2 percent and sustain the economic expansion over the medium 
term, policymakers may judge that the target range for the fede ral funds rate will 
likely need to be raised somewhat further.  
o Policymakers may be focused on i ndicators of a strong labor mar ket, such as 
the employment-to-population ratio of prime-age workers, which at nearly 
80 percent has returned to lev els last seen in 2007.  They may be concerned 
that this labor market tightness, combined with ongoing above-t rend economic

growth, could result in inflati on pressures building to an exte nt that would 
require sizeable inte rest rate increases later on, unless the C ommittee 
continued on the course of gradual increases for  somewhat longe r. 
Policymakers may note that, even after the rate hike at the Dec ember meeting, the
federal funds rate would still li e below prescrip tions from a w ide range of policy
strategies—including those from  most of the simple policy rules  shown in the
“Monetary Policy Strategies”  section of Tealbook A.  If they ju dge that the rules
underlying these prescriptions have  provided reasonable characterizations of past
Committee behavior, policymakers may believe that large, prolon ged deviations from
these prescriptions may increase the risk that inflation will eventually rise appreciably
above 2 percent.
For the above reasons, policymak ers may opt to continue to express their judgment
that “some further gradual incr eases” in the target range for t he federal funds rate are
consistent with meeting their dual-mandate objectives.
Policymakers may also wish to communicate that, although they w ill continue to
monitor global economic and finan cial developments, the risks t o the outlook remain
roughly balanced.
Although Alternative C would be consistent with the widely-held  expectation of no
change in the target range at the upcoming mee ting, retaining t he forward guidance in
Alternative C could come as a s urprise in light of policymakers ’ communications
over the intermeeting period.  Suc h a statement would likely ca use policy rate
expectations to ratchet up in the near term, while equity price s and inflation
compensation would probably fall , and the dollar could apprecia te.

Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation  
The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy 
stance announced by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in its statement on 
December 19, 2018  January 30, 2019 : 
 The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted [ unanimously ] 
to raise  maintain  the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve 
balances to  at 2.40 percent , effective December 20, 2018  January 31, 2019 .  
Setting the interest rate pai d on required and excess reserve b alances 10 basis 
points below the top of the targe t range for the federal funds rate is intended to 
foster trading in the federal funds market at rates well within  the FOMC's 
target range. 
 As part of its policy decision, the F ederal Open Market Committee voted to 
authorize and direct the Open Mar ket Desk at the Federal Reserv e Bank of 
New York, until instructed otherw ise, to execute transactions i n the System 
Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic p olicy 
directive: 
“Effective December 20, 2018  January 31, 2019 , the Federal Open 
Market Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations 
as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target ran ge of 2-1/4 to  
2-1/2 percent, including overnight  reverse repurchase operation s (and 
reverse repurchase operations w ith maturities of m ore than one day when 
necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 2.25 percent, in amounts li mited only 
by the value of Treasury securi ties held outright in the System  Open 
Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per-counterparty limit  of $30 billion per day. 
The Committee directs the Des k to continue rolli ng over at auct ion the 
amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holding s of 
Treasury securities maturing duri ng each calendar month that ex ceeds 
$30 billion, and to continue reinvesting in agency mortgage-backed 
securities the amount of princip al payments from the Federal Re serve’s 
holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities received 
during each calendar month tha t exceeds $20 billion.  Small dev iations 
from these amounts for operati onal reasons are acceptable. 
The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll an d coupon 
swap transactions as necessary t o facilitate settlement of the Federal 
Reserve’s agency mortgage-back ed securities transactions.”

Balance Sheet and Income Projections 
The staff has prepared projecti ons of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the 
associated income statement th at are consistent with the baseli ne forecast i n Tealbook A.  
Key features of these projecti ons are described below.   
The projections incorporate a r evised assumption for future balances of the 
Treasury General Account (TGA).  To account for the recent hist orical pattern, we now 
set the TGA balance at the sta rt of the projection period to a more recent average, rather 
than to the previously-used longe r-run average.  This change sh ifts up the path of the 
TGA by roughly $80 billion.  For the r emainder of the projectio n period we continue to 
assume that the TGA grows in line with nominal GDP.   
As in the December Tealbook, the pr ojections assume that the FO MC’s current 
balance sheet reduction program c ontinues until reserve balance s decline t o $1 trillion, 
roughly $600 billion lower than th eir current level.  Staff pro jects that this level of 
reserve balances will be reached in the first quarter of 2020, one quarter earlier than 
under the previous projection because of the upward revision to  the path for the TGA.  
Evolution of the SOMA portfolio.   The balance sheet normalization program 
initiated in October 2017 has led to the redemption of $247 bil lion of Treasury securities 
and $173 billion of agency secu rities through the end of 2018 ( see the table in the exhibit 
“Redemptions and Reinvestments of SOMA Principal Payments”).  D uring this same 
period, reinvestments of principal payments on Treasury and age ncy securities were 
$224 billion and $152 billion, respect ively.  If the current pl an were to continue through 
the end of 2019, redemptions of Tre asury securities and agency MBS this year would 
total approximately $270 and $180 billion, respectively.1  All told, under these 
projections, redemptions woul d total about $950 billion by the time they cease in the first 
quarter of 2020.  Of this total, red emptions of Treasury and ag ency securities comprise 
about $570 billion and $380 bill ion, respectively. 
1 Further reinvestments of agency  MBS are unlikely to occur and future reinvestments of principal 
from maturing Treasury securitie s will take place primarily in the middle month of each quarter (see the 
bottom panel in the exhibit “Redemptions and Reinvestments of S OMA Principal Paym ents”).  However, 
the projections for agency MBS are subject to considerable unce rtainty because of unscheduled 
prepayments.

By the time that redemptions e nd, the SOMA portfolio is projected to be slightly 
less than $3.4 trillion, consisting of about $1.9 trillion in Treasury securities and 
$1.4 trillion in agency secu
rities .  At that time, the size of the balance sheet is projected to 
stand at roughly 16 percent of nomi nal GDP, with non-reserve liabilities totaling 
11 percent (see the exhibit titled “Total Assets and 
Selected Balance Sheet Items”
).  For 
comparison, the size of the balanc e sheet as a share of nomi
nal GDP peaked at about 
25 percent in 2014 and averaged about 6 percent prior to the crisis.  After redemptions 
cease, SOMA holdings will begin to rise, keeping pace with the increases in Federal 
Reserve liabilities, i ncluding Federal Res erve notes in circulation, the TGA, and Federal 
Reserve Bank capital.   
The share of agency MBS in the SOMA portfolio, which currently stands at 
42 percent, is expected to rise s lightly in the near term, reflecting the faster pace of 
Treasury roll-offs.  This share begins to decline once redempti ons end, reaching 
25 percent in the middle of 2024. 
SOMA portfolio characteristics.  The weighted-average duration of the SOMA 
Treasury portfolio is currently a bout six years (see the top pa nel of the exhibit titled 
“Projections for the Character istics of SOMA Treasury Securities Holdings”).  This 
measure is projected to increas e until early-2020 as redemption s continue an
d longer-
duration securities become a lar ger share of the portfolio.  Af ter norm alization of the size 
of the balance sheet in 2020, the duration of the SOMA Treasury portfolio is projected to 
declin
e as the Desk is assumed to add Treasury b ills to th e por tfolio, reflecting the 
reinvestment of maturing secu rities and the expansion of non-re serve liabili ties.  Once 
Treasury bills are one- third of the Federal Reserve’s Treasury securities portfolio, close 
to their pre-crisis share, further purchas es of Treasury securi ties are assumed to be spread 
across the maturity spectrum (see the bottom
 panel of the exhib it).2  
Federal Reserve remittances.  Remittances to the Treasury are projected to 
decline to $42 billion this
 year from $65 billion in 2018, refle cting the increases in the 
interest rate paid on reserve ba lances in 2019 (see the “Income Projectio ns” exhibit).3  
2 Excluding securities acquired through small-value test operati ons, the SOMA portfolio currently 
contains no Treasury bills. 
3 Remittances in 2018 include two mandated transfers to the Trea sury due to reductions to the 
statutory limit on aggregate Reserve Bank surplus.  First, $2.5  billion was transferred in February 2018 
following an amendment to Section 7 of the Federal Reserve Act by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, 
enacted in that month.  Second, $675 million was transferred in  June 2018, reflecting another amendment

Total interest expense is pro jected to rise by nearly $10 billi on, to $51 billion, this year.4  
In addition, the reduction in SOMA securities holdings this year results in a slight 
decrease in projected interest income to $102 billion.  Remittances are expected to 
decline further and to bott om out at $41 billion in 2020.  Thereafter, remittances rise due 
to an increase in interest inco me associated with a growing bal ance sheet.  The projected 
path for remittances is similar to that in the December Tealbook.  As shown in the bottom 
left panel of the “Income Projections” exhibit, annual remittan ces average about 
0.25 percent of nominal GDP over the projection period, slightl y higher than their pre-
crisis average. 
Unrealized gains or losses.   The SOMA portfolio was  in a net unrealized loss 
position of about $6 billion at the end of December.5  With longer-term interest rates 
expected to rise over the next f ew years, the unrealized loss p osition is expected to peak 
at $215 billion in 2020:Q3.  Of this a mount, $90 billion is att ributable to Treasury 
securities and $125 billion to age ncy MBS.  The net unrealized loss position subsequently 
narrows, as securities acquired unde r the Federal Reserve’s lar ge-scale asset purchase 
programs approach maturity.  Compared to the December Tealbook,  the unrealized loss 
position is projected to be a b it smaller in the near term.  
Term premium effect.   SOMA securities held as a resu lt of the Federal Reserve’s 
asset purchase programs are curre ntly estimated to be reducing the term premium in the 
10-year Treasury yield by about 77 basis points (see the table,  “Projections for the 10-
Year Treasury Term Premium Eff ect”).  This term premium effect (or TPE) is little
changed from the December estimates.6  As was shown in the corresponding table in the
to Section 7 by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Con sumer Protection Act, enacted in May 
2018.  
4 We continue to assume that the FOMC will set a 25 -basis-point-wide target range for the federal 
funds rate throughout the projection period.  Consistent with t he FOMC’s December Im plementation Note, 
we assume that the interest rates paid on reserve balances will  be set 10 basis points below the top of the 
target range.  We continue to assume that the offering rate on overnight RRPs will be set at the bottom of 
the range.  
5 See the Tealbook B box titled “W hat Does it Mean for the SOMA Portfolio to be in an 
‘Unrealized Loss’ Position?” (Jun e 2018) for an explanation of the accounting notions  of unrealized and 
realized gain and loss positions , as well as their implications  for the Federal Reserve’s ability to meet its 
obligations.  
6 The estimated path of the TPE d epends on the difference betwee n the expected path of the 
Federal Reserve’s balance sheet over coming years and a counterfactual projection based on the 
configuration of the Federal Res erve’s balance sheet that preva iled before the financial crisis of 2007-2008.  
In the counterfactual projection, it is assumed that reserve ba lances reach their longer-run level at 
$100 billion.

December 2018 Tealbook, the increas e in the assumption for the longer-run level of 
reserve balances—from 
$500 bill ion to $1 trillion—had only mode st effects on the 
projected path of the TPE.  The path of the TPE is instead most ly driven by how the 
projected trend growth in Federal Reserve liabilities affects t he amount of longer-term 
securities held by the Federal R eserve and by the private secto r.
