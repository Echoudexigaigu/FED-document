Information received since the Committee met in January indicat es that the labor 
market has remained strong but that the growth of economic acti vity has slow ed relative 
to last year’s pace.  Job gains were robust in January but slow ed sharply in February, 
resulting in an average pace of job gains over the past three m onths of 186,000 per 
month.  On the other hand, the unemp loyment rate declined to 3. 8 percent in February 
while the labor force particip ation rate held firm at 63.2 perc ent.  Real GDP expanded at 
a solid pace of 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018.  Whi le a step-down in output 
growth in 2019 had been anticipated for some time, low readings from the most recent 
spending indicators have led to a sizable downward revision in the staff’s projection for 
real GDP growth in the first quarter.  The staff expects a good  portion of the recent 
softness to be transitory, forecasting output growth to bounce back in the second quarter 
and real GDP to grow a little  under 2 percent over 2019.  The s taff estimates that the 
12-month changes in headline and core PCE prices were 1.4 perce nt and 1.8 percent,
respectively, in February.  While  energy prices are expected to  weigh on total inflation
over the next couple of years, cor e inflation is expected to ru n close to 2 percent.
Against this backdrop, the alternative policy statements presen ted below offer a 
range of options for communicating about the lik ely future path  of monetary policy.  
Alternative B is intended to rea ffirm the policy message that was conveyed in the January 
postmeeting statement.  In particular, Alternative B continues to state that the Committee 
will be patient in determining what future adjustments to the t arget range for the federal 
funds rate may be appropriate.  T he case for a patient approach to monetary policy is 
buttressed by the uncertainty abou t the extent to which the rec ent softness in economic 
indicators will prove to be transitory.  Alternative B acknowle dges the slowing in 
economic growth in the first quar ter and, while indicating that  the labor market remains 
strong, downgrades the characteriz ation of the average pace of job gains to “solid.”  The 
statement also notes that lower energy prices are currently holding down headline 
inflation and that, on balance, readings on longer-term inflati on expectations are broadly 
similar to those at the time of the January meeting.  Alternati ve B continues to indicate 
that the Committee views sustai ned expansion of economic activity, strong labor market 
conditions, and inflation near the  Committee’s symmetric 2 perc ent objective as the most 
likely outcomes.

Alternative A conveys a more accommodative posture than Alterna tive B—a 
posture that it portrays as necessary to shore up inflation and  inflation exp ectations.  It 
notes that some survey-based m easures of longer-term inflation expectations have 
declined and, in paragraph 2, provi des a more detailed outlook for inflation in which 
headline inflation is “expected to run below the Committee’s sy mmetric 2 percent 
objective in the near term.”  The draft links the Committee’s i ntention to be pa tient to its 
aim “to support a sustained retur n to 2 percent inflation.”   
In light of comments from FOMC  participants that it would be us eful to consider 
the possible evolution of the “patient” language, Alternative C  is intended to illustrate 
two approaches the Committee coul d consider in the future if th e economy continues to 
perform well and another increase in the federal funds rate mig ht become appropriate.  In 
such circumstances, the charac terization of incoming data in th e first paragraph could go 
a long way toward shaping expect ations.  Because current data do not support such an 
assessment, the draft of Alternative C omits the first paragrap h.  As shown in the second 
paragraph, the Committee could simply eliminate the sentence in cluding the “patient” 
language.  Alternatively, it could replace that sentence with o ne indicating that “some 
further policy firming may become appropriate.” 
With regard to the specifics of the language in Alternatives A,  B, and C: 
 The assessment of the incoming data: 
o Alternatives A and B share the s ame characterizations of much o f the 
incoming data.  Both alternatives  note that the labor market re mains strong 
and that the unemployment rate r emains low.  Noting the weak re ading on 
payroll growth in February, which followed robust growth in Jan uary, the 
alternatives describe average j ob gains in recent months as “solid.”   
Alternatives A and B state that  growth of economic activity has  slowed from 
its solid rate in the fourth qua rter and that “recent indicator s point to slower 
growth of household spending and bus iness fixed investment in t he first 
quarter.”  They also state that “overall inflation has declined , largely as a 
result of lower energy prices” and that “inflation for items ot her than food and 
energy remains near 2 percent.”  
o Regarding indicators of inflation expectations, Alternative B s tates that “on 
balance, market-based measures  of inflation compensation have remained low 
in recent months, and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation

expectations are little changed.”  Alternative A  also states th at market-based 
measures “remain low” but adds that “some survey-based measures  of longer-
term inflation expecta tions have declined.”  
o As noted above, Alternative C om its a description of the incomi ng data 
because it is intended to be considered in some future scenario in which the 
data point toward a potential need for further policy firming. 
 The outlook for economic activity and inflation: 
o Under Alternatives B and C, the outlook for economic activity a nd inflation is 
unchanged from the January state ment.  These alternatives note that the 
Committee “continues to view sus tained expansion of economic activity, 
strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committe e’s symmetric 
2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes.”  
o Alternative A agrees that sust ained expansion of economic activ ity and strong 
labor market conditions are the  most likely outcomes, but then adds that 
“inflation is expected to run below the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent 
objective in the near term and t hen rise gradually toward 2 per cent as labor 
market strength continues and the transitory effects of recent energy price 
declines dissipate.” 
 For the current policy decision and the outlook for policy: 
o All three alternatives maintain t he current target range for th e federal funds 
rate. 
o Alternative B maintains the January perspective that “global ec onomic and 
financial developments and mute d inflation pressures” are facto rs that shape 
the outlook for policy and states that the Committee “will be p atient as it 
determines what future adjustmen ts to the target range for the federal funds 
rate may be appropriate” to support the Committee’s outlook. 
o Alternative A more directly links inflation and the policy outlook, stating that 
“in light of global economic and f inancial developments and to support a 
sustained return to 2 percent inflation, the Committee will be patient as it 
determines” future adjustm ents to the target range. 
o Alternative C presents two options: one in which no outlook for  policy is 
given, and one in which policymakers anticipate that “some furt her policy 
firming may become appropriate.”

JANUARY 2019  FOMC  STATEMENT  
1.Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in December
indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and  that economic
activity has been ris ing at a solid rate.  Job gains have been strong, on average, in
recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low.  Household
spending has continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed
investment has moderated from its  rapid pace earlier last year.   On a 12-month
basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other tha n food and energy
remain near 2 percent.  Although m arket-based measures of infla tion
compensation have moved lower in r ecent months, survey-based me asures of
longer-term inflati on expectations are  little changed.
2.Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum
employment and price stability.  I n support of the se goals, the Committee decided
to maintain the target range fo r the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent.
The Committee continues to view  sustained expansion of economic activity,
strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committe e’s symmetric 2
percent objective as the most likely outcomes.  In light of global economic and
financial developments and mute d inflation pressures, the Commi ttee will be
patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal
funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes.
3.In determining the timing and size  of future adjustments to the  target range for the
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expe cted economic
conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its  symmetric 2
percent inflation objective.  Thi s assessment will take into account a wide range
of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of
inflation pressures and inflati on expectations, and readings on  financial and
international developments.

ALTERNATIVE A FOR MARCH 2019 
1. Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in December 
January  indicates that the labor market  has continued to strengthen an d remains 
strong but  that growth of  economic activity ha s been rising at a slowed from its  
solid rate in the fourth quarter .  Payroll employment was little changed in 
February, but  job gains have been strong solid , on average, in recent months, 
and the unemployment rate has remained low.  Recent indicators point to 
slower growth of  household spending has continued to grow strongly, while 
growth of and business fixed investment has moderated from its rapid pace ea rlier 
last year in the first quarter.  On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation has 
declined, largely as a result of lower energy prices;  and inflation for items 
other than food and energy remain s near 2 percent.  Although Market-based 
measures of inflation compensati on have moved lower in recent m onths remain 
low, and some  survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations ar e 
little changed have declined . 
 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum 
employment and price stability.  I n support of the se goals, the Committee decided 
to maintain the target range fo r the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent.  
The Committee continues to view  sustained expansion of economic activity, and 
strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committe e’s symmetric 2 
percent objective as the most likely outcomes.  Inflation is expected to run 
below the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective in the near  term and 
then rise gradually toward 2 perce nt as labor market strength continues and 
the transitory effects of recent energy price declines dissipat e.  In light of 
global economic and financial deve lopments and muted inflation pressures and to 
support a sustained return to 2 percent inflation , the Committee will be patient 
as it determines what future adj ustments to the target range fo r the federal funds 
rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes. 
 
3. In determining the timing and size  of future adjustments to the  target range for the 
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expe cted economic 
conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its  symmetric 2

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
Economic Conditions and Outlook  
 Much of the recent spending data have been softer than anticipated, indicating that 
growth of economic activity slowe d from its solid rate in the f ourth quarter.  Data on 
retail sales, motor vehicle sales, new orders of capital goods,  construction activity, 
and industrial production indicate t hat the growth rates of household and business 
spending have slowed.  The staff  now projects that real GDP growth in the first 
quarter will be 1 percent, down f rom 2.3 percent at the time of  the January FOMC 
meeting.  Hence, the step-down in gr owth from the previous quar ter is larger than had 
been anticipated in January a nd lowers the overall 2019 growth forecast.  However, in 
light of labor market readings that, on balance, have remained solid over recent 
months, an easing in financial c onditions, and still-favorable consumer sentiment, this 
first quarter weakness is e xpected to be transitory. 
 Available data indicate that the  labor market remains strong. 
o While the January non-farm payrolls  report was stronger than ex pected, the 
February report was considerabl y weaker; weather effects may ex plain a part 
of both surprises.  Smoothing thr ough the volatile readings, no nfarm payroll 
gains averaged a solid 186,000 i n the three months ending in February, a level 
of job growth that remains well a bove the pace that the staff estimates is 
consistent with no change i n resource u tilization. 
o In contrast to the payrolls data, the unemployment rate moved b ack down to 
3.8 percent in February, and the labor force participation rate held at 63.2 
percent.  The unemployment rate  has fluctuated in a limited ran ge around its 
current level over the past year.  Although it remains below al l participants’ 
estimates of the longer-run rate  of unemployment in the Decembe r Summary 
of Economic Projections, policymakers do not expect high levels  of labor 
utilization to genera te notable upward pre ssure on inflation. 
o Consistent with a strong labor m arket, average hourly earnings rose 
3.4 percent over the 12 months ending in February, extending the gradual 
upward trend seen in this s eries in recent years.  
 Headline inflation has been held down by recent declines in ene rgy prices and is 
projected to run a bit below th e Committee’s 2 percent goal, though core inflation is 
projected to remai n near 2 percent.

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

o The staff expects the change i n total and core PCE prices to be 1.4 percent and 
1.8 percent, respectively over th e 12 months ending in February .  Recent 
declines in oil prices are exp ected to weigh on total PCE infla tion in the near 
term. 
o Since the turn of the year, measures of market-based inflation compensation 
have partially reversed their de clines last fall, but the level  of inflation 
compensation 5-to-10 years ahead remains about 25 basis points lower than at 
the time of the September 2018 FOMC meeting.  While the most re cent 
reading of longer-term inflation e xpectations from the Michigan  consumer 
survey represented a decline to the lowes t end of its historica l range, these 
readings can be volatile.   
o After deteriorating markedly lat e last year, investor sentiment  towards risky 
assets has continued to rebound as a result of FOMC communicati ons 
following the January meeting that were more accommodative than  expected 
and renewed optimism regarding trade negotiations with China.  This 
improvement in investor sentim ent led to an easing of financial  conditions 
since the turn of the  year, with increases  in equity prices, declines in yields 
and spreads on corporate bonds, and l ittle change in Treasury y ields.1     
 Nonetheless, a number of downside risks persist.  Continued evi dence of a slowdown 
in foreign growth, ongoing uncertaint y about Brexit and the out come of U.S.-China 
trade negotiations, fiscal polic y uncertainty, and the softer f irst-quarter readings on 
household and business spending data  all pose downside risks for economic activity.  
In addition, indicators of longer-term inflation expectations b ear watching. 
Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers may have anticipat ed a moderation in overall output growth from 2018 
to 2019, and see the somewhat deeper-than-expected dip in estim ated first quarter 
growth rates of household and business spending as transitory.  Consequently, they 
may anticipate a rebound in spending growth over the remainder of 2019 and 
therefore see economic conditions  as evolving broadly in line w ith their expectations, 
notwithstanding not able risks.

 The Committee may see the current dip in headline inflation as transitory—being 
largely a reflection of energy pri ce movements—and anticipate t hat inflation will 
continue to run close to the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent in flation goal over the 
medium term.   
 Seeing muted inflation pressures in the context of near-potential growth and the 
policy rate within the range of estimates of its neutral level,  policymakers may deem 
the current stance of policy as appropriate. 
 In light of the current constellation of incoming and projected  data, policymakers may 
see elevated uncertainty about t he underlying state of the econ omy.  In such a 
circumstance, policymakers may wish to signal that they remain patient and attentive 
to the arrival of new data that may alter their judgement about  the appropriate stance 
of monetary policy. 
 Market quotes along with responses t o the Desk’s latest surveys of primary dealers 
and market participants indicate t hat an increase in the target  range at the March 
meeting is seen as highly unlikel y.  A statement such as Altern ative B also appears 
generally in line with the expectations of respondents to the D esk’s surveys.  In 
particular, respondents appear t o anticipate downgrades to the descriptions of 
household and business spending an d a moderation of the Committee’s description of 
job gains; most respondents expect  no substantial changes to th e economic outlook or 
the “patient” language.  Conseque ntly, a statement along the li nes of Alternative B 
seems unlikely to generate appreci able changes in asset prices.

Monetary  Policy Expectations  and Uncertainty  
Measures  of the expected  path for the federal  funds rate based  on financial 
market prices declined  on net over the  intermeeting  period.  Investors  attributed  
these declines  in part to the January  FOMC communications  that were perceived  
as more accommodative  than expected,  in particular  the indication  that the 
Committee would  be “patient” in  adjusting  the stance of policy.  These and  
subsequent  communications  from polic ymakers appeared  
to outweigh  upward 
pressure on the market‐based path of policy from improved  risk sentiment and,  
on balance, positive responses  to domestic data  releases.  Respondents  to the 
Desk’s March surveys  similarly revised down  their federal funds  rate  projections.   
Quotes on federal funds futures contrac ts imply that 
investors  continue  to attach  
virtually zero probability  to a 25‐ basis‐point increase in  the target range  for the 
federal funds  rate at the March FOMC  meeting (not shown).  Looking  further 
ahead, a straight read  of the probability  distribution  for the federal  funds rate at 
the end of 2019 implied by 
options quotes became noticeably  less dispersed,  with 
the mode of the distribution  suggesting  no change to the federal funds rate 
through the end of this year (figure 1).   In contrast,  the median of  respondents’  
modal expectations  in the Desk’s March surveys  points to one 25‐basis‐point  rate 
hike in 2019, with the  most likely timing of that rate  hike the December  FOMC 
meeting.   Relative  to the January  surveys, the median respondent  now expects 
one fewer rate hike this year (not  shown).    
Figure 2 compares  the current level of  various measures  of the expected  federal 
funds rate over the  next few years.  A straight  read of forward rates  derived from  
overnight  index 
swap quotes (the solid blue line) suggests  that investors  expect 
the federal funds rate to remain  close to its current level through  2019 and to 
decline about 20 basis points in 2020.  In contrast,  the latest path from  a staff 
term structur e model 
that adjusts for term premiums  (the sold red line) 
continues  to suggest further gradual increases  in the federal funds  rate; about 35 
basis points in 2019 and additional  increases  thereafter.   Of note,  the path from 
the staff’s model beyond 2019 lies above the projecti ons from the March  Blue 
Chip survey (the yellow diamonds)1, as well as above the  modal path reported  by 
the median respondent to the  Desk’s March surveys (the brown line).  As shown 
by the dashed lines in figure 2, both the unadjusted  and adjusted  market‐based 
paths declined  about 10 basis points for end‐2019 and end‐2020. 
Figure 3 shows the dispersion  of respondents’  modal federal funds  rate 
projections  from the Desk’s March surveys (in blue)  relative to the January 
surveys (in

rate and is scaled in size by the number of respondents  making that projection.   
While dispersion  is low among respondents’  modal projections  for the federal 
funds rate at  the end of 2019, projections  become noticeably  dispersed  at longer  
horizons.   A small number of respondents  continue  to have modal projections  
that decline substantially  in 2020 and  2021. 
Figure 4 shows measures  of the longer‐run expected  federal funds  rate.  A 
straight read of forward rates  at longer  horizons implied by Treasury yields (the 
blue line) suggests  that investors’  current expectation  for the average  federal 
funds rate 5 to  10 years ahead declined  a bit to about  2.8 percent.   Adjusting  for 
term premiums using  various staff term structure
 models (with the  light‐ red‐
shaded region showing  a range of  three such model estimates)  continues  to 
suggest that 5‐to‐ 10‐year‐ ahead expectations  are above the unadjusted  forward 
rates, at between 3.1  and 3.9 percent,  consistent  with a negative  term premium  
at those
 horizons.   In contrast,  surveys of professional  forecasters  suggest that 
longer‐run expectations  lie closer to the unadjusted  forward rates; the  average 
longer‐run forecast  from the December  Blue Chip  survey (the yellow diamonds)  
and the median forecast  from the Desk’s March  surveys (the green  diamonds)

 value of the SOMA portfolio at the  end of 2019, conditional  on different levels  
for the target  federal funds  rate at year‐ end.  Figure 5 shows the medians  and 
interquartile  range s 
of the individual  responses.   If the federal funds  rate ends 
the year at or  above its  current level, the  median respondent  expects the value of 
the SOMA portfolio to decline  from its end‐February  level of $3.8 trillion (the 
dotted line) to about $3.5 trillion  by year‐ end (the blue bars), roughly $100 billio n 
higher than in 
the January surveys (the green bars).   Respondents  continue  to 
expect the value of the SOMA portfolio to fall by less  if the federal funds  rate 
ends the year below its current level. 
A new question  in the Desk’s March surveys  asked respondents  to provide their 
most 
likely timing for the announcement  and initial implementation  of a plan to  
stop reducing  the Federal Reserve’s  asset holdings.   The median of  respondents’  
modal expectation is  for such a plan  to be announced  at the March  meeting with 
an initial implementation  to occur in the third quarter of 2019 (not shown).   
Figure  6 
shows results from another new question  which asked respondents  to 
state their  most likely timing for when  they expect the domestic SOMA  portfolio 
to first exhibit material  quarter‐over‐ quarter growth.  Respondents  generally  
expect growth to first occur in 2020, although respondents  had disperse  views 
about which quarter this 
initial growth is most likely to occur.  In a repeat of a 
question last asked in the Desk’s December  2018 surveys,  the median respondent  
now expects reserve balances  to reach a  lowest average weekly level of  $1.2 
trillion between  now and the end of 2025, $200 billion  higher than in December.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A  
Alternative A conveys a more accommodative monetary policy post ure than 
Alternative B.  It emphasizes a m ore downbeat interpretation of  current measures of 
longer-term inflation expectations, highli ghts that inflation is expected to run below the 
Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective in the near term, and directly links the 
Committee’s intention to be patient with its g oal of supporting a sustained return to 
2 percent inflation.  This would signal a reduction in the likelihood of future target range 
increases, particularly in the  near-term, and perhaps increase the perceived odds of 
reductions in the policy rate down the road.   
Policymakers may wish to expre ss greater concern about inflatio n expectations. 
The most recent Michigan consumer survey reports that 5-10 year  inflation exp ectations 
dropped 0.3 percentage points to 2. 3 percent in February, a lev el reached only once 
before in the survey’s histor y.  Meanwhile, 5-to-10 year TIPS-b ased inflation 
compensation declined noticeably last fall and, while it has in creased somewhat since the 
turn of the year, it remains a bout 25 basis points below its le vel at the time of the 
September FOMC.  Policymakers could judge that market-based mea sures of forward 
inflation compensation “remain l ow” and that “some survey-based  measures of longer-
term inflation expecta tions have declined.”   
Policymakers may judge that solid  job growth and gradually firm ing 
compensation data indicate that t he labor market improved at a steady pace over the past 
few years without generating a s izable increas e in inflation, w hich continues to run below 
the Committee’s symmetric 2 per cent objective.  Meanwhile, rece nt data suggest that the 
growth rates of household and busin ess spending have been slowi ng from their pace last 
year.  Although the current drag on headline inflation from ene rgy prices is expected to 
be transitory, policymakers may now  see more significant risks that inflation could fail to 
return to the Committee’s 2 percen t objective on a sustained ba sis, particularly if resource 
utilization were to soften.  If so, they may favor Alternative A, which notes that inflation 
“is expected to run below the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent o bjective in the near term 
and then rise gradually toward 2 pe rcent as labor market streng th continues and the 
transitory effects of recent energy price declines dissipate.”   
If policymakers judge that the risk of inflation running persis tently below target 
has increased, they may deem it  prudent to emphasize their comm itment to support a 
sustained return of inflation to t he Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective.

Additionally, despite the recent improvement in financial condi tions, the risks posed by 
global economic and financial developments remain significant.  Alternative A states: “In 
light of global economic and financial developments and to supp ort a sustained return to 
2 percent inflation, the Committ ee will be patient as it determ ines what future 
adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate.”  
A statement from the Committee su ch as Alternative A could be seen by market 
participants as signaling a more accommodative path for the pol icy rate than had been 
anticipated.  If this was perceiv ed as a reaction to the worsen ing economic outlook, 
market expectations for the fed eral funds rate would likely fal l, together with equity 
prices, the exchange value of the dollar, and possibly inflatio n compensation.  However, 
if market participants judged A lternative A as indicating a more accommodative policy 
reaction function, then equity pri ces and inflation compensatio n would likely rise, while 
market expectations for the fed eral funds rate would fall. 
 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C  
Alternative C illustrates two possi bilities the Committee could  consider in 
circumstances in which the economy continues to perform well an d the case for further 
increases in the target range f or the federal funds rate has materially strengthened.  
Because Alternative C is primarily meant to spur thinking on fu ture statement language 
in circumstances different from the current juncture, it omits the usual discussion of 
recent data in the first paragraph.  Presumably, at a time when  Alternative C became 
appropriate, the language of the  first paragraph would signal a  view of a strengthening 
economy or firming inflation; it is  also possible that either o f these signals would be in 
postmeeting statements prior to t he removal of the “patient” la nguage.  
If policymakers see a growing likelihood for another increase in the target range 
and believe that the “patient” language may no longer be approp riate, one option may be 
to simply eliminate the senten ce stating that “In light of glob al economic and financial 
developments and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will be patient as it 
determines what future adjustmen ts to the target range for the federal funds rate may be 
appropriate to support these outcomes.”  Policymakers may see t he characterization of 
the incoming economic data in paragraph 1 as the primary way to  signal that the 
economic outlook has changed.  They may therefore simply prefer to omit the sentence, 
Alternatives

Page 15 of 34
Authorized for Public Release
   
particularly if policymakers wi sh to avoid any form of explicit  forward guidance about 
policy rate decisions, even in the near-term.  
Alternative C includes a second option, which is to replace the  “patient” sentence 
with “The Committee anticipates t hat some further policy firmin g may be become 
appropriate to support these outcomes.”  This alternative repre sents a more direct 
acknowledgment of the potential f or rate hikes, and it borrows the “some further policy 
firming” language from FOMC sta tements used at the end of the p revious tightening 
cycle in 2006.  Policymakers may see this option as addressing a need to provide more 
clarity than is given by simply dele ting the sentence containin g the “patient” language.  
While the sentence indicates a bias toward an increase in the t arget range in the future, 
the inclusion of the phrase “may become” limits the commitment implied by the change 
in language.  The Committee ma y feel that this kind of guidance  implies less risk of a 
policy surprise, while preserving optionality for future rate h ikes.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTE 
Under any of the Alternatives, the Committee would issue an imp lementation note 
that indicates no change to the Fed eral Reserve’s administered rates—the interest rate on 
required and excess reserve bala nces, the offering rate on over night reverse repurchase 
agreements, and the primary cred it rate.  In the draft implementation note on the 
following pages, two versions of the paragraph that directs the  Desk’s Treasury securities 
redemptions are provided:  One t hat corresponds to a decision t o continue Treasury 
securities redemptions at thei r current pace and one that corre sponds to a decision to taper 
the cap on Treasury securities redemptions to $20 billion per m onth on April 1.  As usual,

to maintain the interest rate pa id on required and excess reser ve balances at 
2.40 percent , effective January 31, 2019 March 21, 2019 .   
 As part of its policy decision, the F ederal Open Market Committee voted to 
authorize and direct the Open Mar ket Desk at the Federal Reserv e Bank of 
New York, until instructed otherw ise, to execute transactions i n the System 
Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic p olicy 
directive: 
“Effective January 31, 2019 March 21, 2019 , the Federal Open Market 
Committee directs the Desk to unde rtake open market operations as 
necessary to maintain the federal  funds rate in a target range of 2-1/4 to  
2-1/2 percent, including overnight  reverse repurchase operation s (and 
reverse repurchase operations w ith maturities of m ore than one day when 
necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 2.25 percent, in amounts li mited only 
by the value of Treasury securi ties held outright in the System  Open 
Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per-counterparty limit  of $30 billion per day. 
The Committee directs the Des k to continue rolli ng over at auct ion the 
amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holding s of 
Treasury securities maturing duri ng each calendar month that ex ceeds 
$30 billion, and to continue reinvesting in agency mortgage-backed 
securities the amount of princip al payments from the Federal Re serve’s

Balance Sheet and Income Projections 
The staff has prepared projecti ons of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the 
associated income statement th at are consistent with the baseli ne forecast i n Tealbook A.  
Key features of these projecti ons are described below.   
As in the January Tealbook, the projections assume that the red uction of the size 
of the balance sheet continues un til reserve balances decline t o $1 trillion, about 
$700 billion lower than their current level.1  In the current Tealbook, the staff kept policy 
assumptions regarding the near-ter m evolution of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet 
unchanged from the January Tealbook.  However, the projections incorporate revisions to 
several technical assumpti ons as explained below.  
First, the assumptions for the  paths of various liability items  have been revised.  
Previously, all liability items ot her than reserves, Federal Re serve notes, and the Treasury 
General Account (TGA) were assumed to remain constant at their most recent monthly 
values throughout the project ion period, and reserve balances w ere assumed to remain 
constant once they reached $1 trillion.2  As a result, along the projection contour, 
liabilities other tha n Federal Reserve notes  and the TGA were d eclining as a share of 
nominal GDP.  The projections now a ssume that all liability ite ms, including reserve 
balances, the foreign repo pool, and DFMU balances, grow in lin e with nominal GDP 
after the level of reserve bala nces reaches $1 trillion in order to accommodate increasing 
demand for Federal Reserve liabilities.3  This change implies that the size of the  
1 For illustrative purposes, the current projections continue to  assume that the average level of 
reserves will stabilize at $1 tri llion.  However, as discussed in the March FOMC memo  “Transitioning to an 
Ample Reserves Regime with Lower Reserves,” the actual level at  which reserves stabilize will need to be 
chosen in light of information on banks’ reserve demand.  
2 Reflecting historical growth over recent years, Federal Reserv e notes in circulation are assumed 
to increase at an av erage annual pace of a bout 6 percent throug h 2021, and to grow at the same pace as 
nominal GDP thereafter.  The value of the TGA balance at the st art of the projection period is now set to 
the most recent three-month histor ical average that would exclu de those months within debt-limit episodes, 
whereas in the January Tealbook t he TGA balance at the start of the projection was set to its most recent 
monthly average.  This revised assumption smooths the effects o f historical monthly swings in the TGA 
balance on its project ed levels and, at the same time, prevents  large changes that occu r during debt-limit 
episodes from affecting the projected longer-run path for the T GA.  For the remainder of the projection 
period, we continue to assume tha t the TGA grows in line with n ominal GDP.   
3 Historically, reserves have not  grown in line with nominal GDP.  However, in an ample reserves 
operating regime with reserves remunerated at a rate close to t hat on other short-term investments,  
it seems likely that banks’ dema nd for reserves will expand ove r time roughly in line with the expansion of 
total bank assets.  We assume that bank assets, in turn, will g row in line with nominal GDP.

 Federal Reserve’s balance shee t relative to nominal GDP is proj ected to be constant in 
the long run. 
Second, the staff has adopted a  new methodology to calculate th e effect of SOMA 
securities holdings on the term premium embedded in longer-term  interest rates.  Going 
forward, Tealbook projections will report the total effect of all SOMA securities 
holdings, rather than focusing solely on the effect of the hold ings accumulated as a result 
of the Federal Reserve’s asset  purchase programs.  Further deta ils of this new 
methodology and its implications f or the projections are discus sed in the last section 
“Total Term Premium Effect.”  
Evolution of the SOMA portfolio.   The staff projects that, under the balance sheet 
normalization program initiated in October 2017, redemptions th rough 2019:Q1 will total 
$316 billion of Treasury securi ties and $218 billion of agency securities (see the table in 
the exhibit “Redemptions and Rei nvestments of SOMA Principal Pa yments”).  During 
this same period, reinvestments  of principal payments on Treasury and agency securities 
are projected to be $250 billion and $152 billion, respectively .4  Under the current 
assumptions, redemptions would total about $950 billion by the time they cease in the 
first quarter of 2020.  Of this tot al, redemptions of Treasury and agency securities 
comprise about $565 billion and $383 b illion, respectively. 
By the time the decline in reser ves ends, the size of the SOMA portfolio is 
projected to be slightly less than $3.4 trillion, consisting of  about $1.9 trillion in Treasury 
securities and $1.4 tri llion in agency securities.  At that time, the size of the balance sheet 
is projected to stand at roughly 16 pe rcent of nominal GDP, with nonreserve liabilities 
totaling 11 percent (see the bottom  panels of the exhibit title d “Total Assets and Selected 
Balance Sheet Items”).  Because of the new assumption for the e volution of liability 
items, once the decrease in reser ves is halted, the size of the  balance sheet is projected to 
remain at a constant 16 percent share of GDP.  For comparison, the size of the  
balance sheet as a share of GD P peaked at about 25 percent in t he fourth quarter of 2014 
and averaged about 5 percent over the decade prior to the crisi s.   
                                                 
4 Further reinvestments of agency  MBS are unlikely to occur and future reinvestments of principal 
from maturing Treasury securitie s will take place primarily in the middle month of each quarter (see the 
bottom panel in the exhibit “Redemptions and Reinvestments of S OMA Principal Paym ents”).  However, 
the projections for agency MBS are subject to considerable unce rtainty because of unscheduled 
prepayments.

 After reserves reach $1 trilli on, which is projected to occur in the first quarter of 
2020, SOMA holdings are projected  to start rising, keeping pace  with increases in 
Federal Reserve liabilities and Federal Reserve Bank capital.  Relative to the January 
Tealbook, SOMA holdings are projected  to increase at a faster p ace after reserves reach 
$1 trillion.  This upward revisi on to the path of SOMA holdings  primarily reflects the 
steeper path of reserve balances , as a result of the new assump tion that all liabilities grow 
in line with nominal GDP once re serve balances reach $1 trillio n. 
The share of agency MBS in the S OMA portfolio, which currently stands at 
42 percent, is expected to rise s lightly in the near term, refl ecting the faster pace of 
Treasury roll-offs.  This share begins to decline once redempti ons end, reaching a little 
less than 20 per cent by the end of 2025. 
SOMA portfolio characteristics.   The weighted-average  duration of the SOMA 
Treasury portfolio is currently a bout six years (see the top pa nel of the exhibit titled 
“Projections for the Character istics of SOMA Treasury Securities Holdings”).  This 
measure is projected to increas e until early 2020 as redemption s continue and longer-
duration securities become a lar ger share of the portfolio.  Af ter the level of reserves 
reaches $1 trillion, the duration of  the SOMA Treasury portfoli o is projected to decline as 
the Desk is assumed to add Treasury bills to the portfolio, ref lecting the reinvestment of 
maturing securities and growth i n liabilities.  Once Treasury b ills are one-third of the 
Federal Reserve’s Treasury securi ties portfolio, close to their  pre-crisis share, further 
purchases of Treasury securities are assumed to be spread across the maturity spectrum 
(see the bottom panel of the exhibit).5  
Federal Reserve remittances.   Remittances to the Treasury are projected to 
decline to $43 billion this  year from $65 billion in 2018, refl ecting the increases in the 
interest rate paid on reserve ba lances in 2019 (see the “Income  Projections” exhibit).6  
                                                 
5 Excluding securities acquired through small-value test operati ons, the SOMA portfolio currently 
contains no Treasury bills. 
6 Remittances in 2018 include two mandated transfers to the Trea sury due to reductions to the 
statutory limit on aggregate Reserve Bank surplus.  First, $2.5  billion was transferred in February 2018 
following an amendment to Section 7 of the Federal Reserve Act by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, 
enacted in that month.  Second, $675 million was transferred in  June 2018, reflecting another amendment 
to Section 7 by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Con sumer Protection Act, enacted in May 
2018.

 Total interest expense is projected to rise by $5 billion this year, to $48 billion.7  In 
addition, the reduction in SOMA securities holdings results in a slight decrease in 
projected interest income to $100 billion this year.  Remittanc es are expected to increase 
slightly to $44 billion in 2020.  Thereafter, remittances rise reflecting an increase in 
interest income associated with a growing balance sheet.   
In comparison to the January Tealbook, the rela tively larger si ze of the Federal 
Reserve’s balance sheet over th e projection period as a result of the revised assumption 
for the growth of liabilities l eads to both higher interest inc ome and higher interest 
expense after reserves reac h $1 trillion.  Because the levels o f the interest r ates earned on 
asset holdings and the interest rate paid on liabilities are ge nerally close over the 
projection horizon, the higher co ntours of interest income and interest expense offset 
each other, leaving the projected path for remittances little c hanged relative to the 
January Tealbook.  As shown in the bottom left panel of the “In come Projections” 
exhibit, annual remittances are projected to remain about 0.2 p ercent of nominal GDP 
over the next few years, similar to their pre-crisis average, and to rise to about 0.3 percent 
thereafter. 
Unrealized gains or losses.   The SOMA portfolio was  in a net unrealized loss 
position of about $6 billion at the end of February.8  With longer-term interest rates 
projected to rise over the next few years, t he unrealized loss position is expected to peak 
at $143 billion in 2021:Q4.  Of this a mount, $54 billion is att ributable to Treasury 
securities and $89 billion to age ncy MBS.  The net unrealized loss position subsequently 
narrows, as securities acquired unde r the Federal Reserve’s lar ge-scale asset purchase 
programs approach maturity.  Com pared with the January Tealbook , the unrealized loss 
position is projected to be modera tely less negative in the nea r term due to a lower 
projected path for longer- term interest rates.  
                                                 
7 We continue to assume that the FOMC will set a 25 -basis-point-wide target range for the federal 
funds rate throughout the projection period.  Consistent with t he FOMC’s December Im plementation Note, 
we assume that the interest rates paid on reserve balances will  be set 10 basis points below the top of the 
target range.  We continue to assume that the offering rate on overnight RRPs will be set at the bottom of 
the range.  
8 See the Tealbook B box titled “W hat Does it Mean for the SOMA Portfolio to be in an 
‘Unrealized Loss’ Position?” (Jun e 2018) for an explanation of the accounting notions  of unrealized and 
realized gain and loss positions , as well as their implications  for the Federal Reserve’s ability to meet its 
obligations.

 Total term premium effect :  In previous Tealbooks, the staff reported the term 
premium effect (TPE) embedded in the 10-year Treasury yield of SOMA securities 
holdings resulting from the Large Scale Asset Purchases (LSAPs)  and the Maturity 
Extension Program (MEP).  The estimated path of this term premi um effect depended on 
the deviation of the projected pat h of the Federal Reserve’s ba lance sheet over coming 
years from a “counterfactual” p rojection based on the configura tion of the Federal 
Reserve’s balance sheet that w ould have prevailed if the LSAPs and MEP had not 
occurred.    
Because the configuration of asse ts and liabilities on the Fede ral Reserve’s 
balance sheet has evolved since the crisis for reasons unrelated to the LSAPs and MEP, 
defining the counterfact ual projection required for this method ology has become 
increasingly challenging.  One example is nonreserve liabilitie s other than currency, 
which in the counterfactual proj ection were assumed to remain at their levels prevailing 
before the crisis.  While one c ould argue that these liabilitie s would have not reached 
their current levels without the asset purchase programs, many factors other than asset 
purchases have likely affected the  demand for Federal Reserve liabilities.  Trying to 
identify the extent to which liability items would have changed  in the absence of asset 
purchase programs required increasingly strong assumptions that  have had sizable 
implications for the reported es timates of the term premium eff ect. 
Starting from the current Tealbook, the staff will report the t otal effect of all 
SOMA securities holdings on the t erm premium embedded in longer -term interest rates.  
This new measure, labeled the “to tal term premium effect” (TTPE), gauges how the 
Federal Reserve’s total securi ties holdings affect the term pre mium relative to a 
counterfactual scenario in whic h the Federal Reserve would hold  a securities portfolio of 
the same size but with zero dur ation and, thus, no effect on te rm premiums embedded in 
long-term interest rates.9 
The TTPE will allow the staff to measure the effects of any policy change that 
affects the balance sheet, in cluding not only potential new LSA Ps or MEPs, but also 
changes in the composition of securities holdings.  Moving forw ard, to evaluate the 
effects of a policy change, the staff will compare the TTPE est imates under two 
                                                 
9 As was the case for the TPE, the TTPE measure is reported unde r the assumption that the 
Treasury does not change its issuance patterns in response to t he Federal Reserve’s s ecurities holdings. As 
such, the TTPE provides an upper bound for the magnitude of the  effect of SOMA securities holdings on 
longer-term interest rates.

 scenarios: one with the change  and one without.  With this prac tice, estimates will be 
easy to compare over time without the need to adjust for differences in the assumptions 
underlying a counterfa ctual projection. 
Currently, the TTPE of the overa ll SOMA securities portfolio is estimated to be 
reducing the term premium i n the 10-year Treasury yield by abou t 130 basis points, as 
opposed to reducing it by 77 basis po ints for just the LSAPs an d the MEP (see the 
“Projections for the 10-Year Treasury (Total) Term Premium Effect” exhibit).  The 
magnitude of the TTPE is estimated to become less negative by a bout 2 basis points per 
year, on average, through 2030, genera lly as a result of a decr ease in the duration of the 
Federal Reserve’s securities holdings.   
 Over the entire projection peri od, the path of t he TTPE is mor e negative relative 
to the path of the TPE reporte d in the January Tealbook.  The d ifference between these 
two paths is primarily driven by t wo factors.  First, the TTPE estimate based on the 
overall effect of the Federal Res erve’s balance sheet results i n a parallel downward shift 
of about 50 basis points relative to the TPE calculated on the basis of a comparison 
between the pre- and post-crisis balance sheet configurations.  This factor is shown by the 
difference between the dotted re d line and the dashed blue line in the chart “(Total) Term 
Premium Effect.”  Specifically, the more negative TTPE estimate  reflects the greater 
downward pressure exerted on longer- term interest rates by the total securities holdings 
in the Federal Reserve’s portfo lio, rather than solely reporting the effects of the securities 
held as a result of the asset  purchase programs as under the TP E measure.  Second, 
because of the new assumption for the growth of liabilities, the TTPE implied by the March Tealbook projection is more ne gative and flatter, as can be observed by comparing 
the black line with the dashed blue line in the exhibit.  As liability items are now assumed to grow at the same pace as nominal GDP after reserve balances reach $1 trillion, the 
balance sheet is co rrespondingly larger, which results in an increasingly more negative 
TTPE path than would otherwise be  the case.  Consequently, the TTPE estimate is about 
2 basis points more negative at t he start of the projection and  about 15 basis points more 
negative by 2030 than would be the case without the change in t he assumption for the 
growth of liabilities.
