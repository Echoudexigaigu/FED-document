Information received since the Committee met in March indicates  that the labor 
market has remained strong.  Payrolls rose 196,000 in March, following the weak reading 
in February.  For the first quart er as a whole, job gains avera ged 180,000 per month—a 
solid rate of job growth but slo wer than the average monthly pa ce for 2018.  The 
unemployment rate held steady a t 3.8 percent in March.  Recent data on household 
spending and business fixed investment have been consistent wit h GDP growth slowing 
in the first quarter from its strong pace in 2018, albeit by le ss than previously projected.  
Consumer price data have been sof ter than expected in recent mo nths.  Based on current 
information, the staff estimates that core PCE inflation was 1. 6 percent over the 
12 months ending in March and projects it to edge up to 1.8 percent by the end of the 
year.  
Against this backdrop, the alter native policy statements presen ted below offer a 
range of options for communicati ng the likely future path of monetary policy.  
Alternative B is intended to rea ffirm the policy message that was conveyed in the March 
postmeeting statement.  The case for a “patient” approach to mo netary policy is 
buttressed by the recent downside surprise to inflation as well  as by remaining 
uncertainty about the extent to w hich the recent softness in economic indicators will 
prove to be transitory.  Alternativ e B continues to indicate th at, based on the current 
stance of policy, the Committee views sustained expansion of economic activity, strong 
labor market conditions, and infla tion near the Committee’s sym metric 2 percent 
objective as the most likely outcomes. 
Alternative A conveys a more-accommodative posture than Alterna tive B by 
replacing the “patient” charact erization with a signal that a cut in the federal funds rate 
may soon be appropriate.  This alte rnative notes that inflation  is “softening” and that, 
consequently, the Committee will “assess whether it may soon become appropriate to 
adjust the target range” to ach ieve the Committee’s desired out comes. 
Alternative C is based on some future scenario in which the eco nomy continues to 
perform well and another increase in the federal funds rate may  be seen as appropriate.  
Under such a scenario, the characterization of incoming data in  the first paragraph could 
go a long way in shaping expectations for policy.  Because curr ent data do not support 
such an assessment, and continuing the practice followed in the  March Tealbook, no first

 paragraph is presented for Altern ative C.  As noted in the seco nd paragraph, the 
Committee could mention the develo pments justifying a firmer po licy stance and signal 
that “it may soon become appropriate to adjust the target range .” 
With regard to the specifics of the language in Alternatives A,  B, and C: 
 The assessment of the incoming data: 
o Alternatives A and B share the s ame characterization of the inc oming data.  
Both alternatives note that the labor market remains strong, th at the 
unemployment rate remains low, and that average job gains in recent months 
have been “solid.”  Alternatives A and B state that “economic a ctivity has 
been rising at a moderate rat e” and that “growth of household spending and 
business fixed investment slowed i n the first quarter.”  The al ternatives also 
note that “overall inflation a nd inflation for items other than  food and energy 
have declined and are running be low 2 percent.”  Regarding indicators of 
inflation expectations, Alterna tives A and B continue to state that “on balance, 
market-based measures of inflation compensation have remained l ow in recent 
months, and survey-based measur es of longer-term inflation expe ctations are 
little changed.” 
o As noted above, Alternative C om its a description of the incomi ng data 
because it is intended to be considered in some future scenario in which the 
data point toward a potential need for further policy firming. 
 The outlook for economic activity and inflation: 
o Under all three alte rnatives, the outlook f or economic activity  and inflation is 
unchanged from the March statement.  However, to achieve the outcomes of “sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, 
and inflation near the Committee’ s symmetric 2 percent objectiv e” the 
alternatives condition on potentially different paths for the f ederal funds rate. 
 For the current policy decision and the outlook for policy: 
o All three alternatives maintain t he current target range for th e federal funds 
rate. 
o Alternative B maintains the March perspective that “global econ omic and 
financial developments and mute d inflation pressures” are facto rs that shape 
the outlook for policy and states that the Committee “will be p atient as it

determines what future adjustmen ts to the target range for the federal funds 
rate may be appropriate” to support the Committee’s outlook. 
oAlternative A links the polic y outlook predominantly to inflati on.  In
particular, it states that “i n light of softening inflation, th e Committee will
assess whether it may soon become appropriate to adjust the tar get range for
the federal funds rate.”
oBy contrast, Alternative C offe rs an illustrative selection of circumstances
under which an increase in the federal funds rate “may soon bec ome
appropriate.”  Specifically, the a lternative lists  “firmer infl ation readings,”
“tightening resource utilization, ” or “diminished risks to the outlook” as
possible reasons for considering a change in the stance of poli cy.

The 199596 Mid‐Cycle  Rate Adjustments 
A number 
of market commentaries  have discussed  whether,  in light of recent lower 
inflation readings,  a reduction in  the target range for the  federal funds  rate might 
become appropriate to support a sustained  return of inflation to 2 percent alongside  
strong labor market conditions.   With inflation running  below 2 percent and economic 
growth moderating,  inflation expectatio ns 
could drift downward, potentially  making 
the current setting of the federal funds rate unwantedly  restrictive.  Some  
commentaries  pointed back to several instances  in the mid‐ 1990s when the  Committee  
was perceived  as taking out insurance  by cutting the federal funds  rate after  a series of 
rate hikes.   This box analyzes  the circumstances  behind the mid‐ cycle adjustments  of 
policy rates during 1995 and  1996.  
Starting in February 1994, the FOMC began
 raising interest rates to forestall an increase 
in inflation.   Over the next year, the Committee raised  the federal funds  rate from  
3 percent  to 6 percent (figure 1).  These  rate hikes  prevented  inflation from rising, while 
the unemployment  rate continued  to
 decline (figure 2).  After the final tightening  step 
in February  1995, participants  viewed the economy  as having moved to a more  
sustainable path,  even though some inflationary  pressures  still persisted.   By the time of 
the July 1995  meeting,  however,  signs of a sharp slowing in economic  activity were 
accumulating.   At 
that meeting, the  Committee decided  to cut the  federal funds rate 
target by  25 basis points.  Two more 25 basis point reductions  occurred  in December  
1995 and January 1996.  These adjustments  were intended  to provide insurance  against 
the risk of an undue weakening  of econo mic activity. 
The news  leading 
up to the July  1995 meeting  consisted  almost entirely of surprises  on 
the downside.  The economy  had softened  to a greater  extent  than participants  had 
anticipated.   Nonfarm  payroll employment  had fallen in April and  May, and the 
unemployment  rate in May had risen somewhat  from its first‐quarter average.   The
 
central tendency  of participants’  projections,  submitted  for the Monetary  Policy Report, 
for real GDP growth in 1995 fell from  2 to 3 percent  in February  to 1½ to 2 percent in 
early July.  Pessimism  brought on by the decline in jobs was reinforced  by the string of 
negative reports on retail  sales, industri al production,  and the 
leading indicators.  
At the July 1995 meeting,  most participants  perceived  the pause in the expansion  to be 
temporary  and anticipated  that economic  activity would grow near its potential  rate 
later in the year.  However,  the risk of a more pronounced  slowdown  figured 
prominently  in the 
Committee’s  discussion.   With inflation still  running near 3 percent,  
above what participants  considered  to be consistent  with the price stability mandate,  
the key question  the Committee confronted  was whether  an easing  in the stance of  
policy to support the  expa nsion would  risk  forestallin g further progress toward  
reducing inflation.   In the event, and as noted earlier, the  Committee  cut the federal 
funds rate by 25 basis points.  Participants  viewed this adjustment  as appropriate 
insurance  against the risk of a more persistent slowdown.  Although  participants  
discussed  a 50 basis point  cut, that opti on was dismissed   because, as Chairman

Greenspan put  it, they were “concerned  about spooking  the markets.”  They  agreed 
that there was  little harm  in leaving a further reduction to a future  meeting.  
In the following  months, the economic  expansion  picked up again without  notable 
upward pressure  on inflation.   Towards  the end of the year, however,  the economy  
again showed  signs of slowing.  Moreover,  the minutes of 
the December  1995 FOMC  
meeting noted that “inflation  had slowed from the elevated  pace observed  in the early 
part of the year.”  Measures  of inflation expectations  had also declined  over the  
previous months, suggesting  that the real federal funds  rate had increased.   Against the  
backdrop  of a policy stance that most  judged as some what restrictive,  participants  
at 
the December  meeting discussed  the merits of taking an “opportunistic  approach”  to 
achieving  further disinflation.   Easing the stance of  policy somewhat  further was seen 
as reducing  the risk of a more pronounced  economic  slowdown  without forestalling  
further gradual disinflation,  as participants  noted eme rging signs of positive 
supply side 
developments  as well as muted inflation pressures  abroad.  In light of these 
considerations,  at both the December  1995 and January 1996 meetings, the Committee 
decided to reduce  the federal funds rate target by  25 basis points. 
1995  ended with inflation  below 3  percent, alongside  a low and steady unemployment  
rate of around 5½ percent.   Real GDP growth came down from around 4 percent in 
1994 to about  2 percent in 1995, but no  recession  ensued.  After the rate cut  in January 
1996, the federal funds  rate target remained stable  until the fall of 1998, with the 
exception  of one rate increase  in March  1997.  
During this period, real GDP growth 
rebounded  and the unemployment  rate drifted  lower, while  the Committee’s  
discussions  paid considerable attention  to the evolution  of actual and projected  
inflation.  Although  high resource  utilization  started to be reflecte d in wage increases,  
core inflation continued  
to trend lower.   Starting in early 1997, participants  expressed 
greater confidence  in the possible role of faster‐than‐reported  productivity  increases  as 
the source of  the benign behavior of  inflation.

MARCH 2019  FOMC  STATEMENT  
1.Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in January
indicates that the labor marke t remains strong bu t that growth of economic
activity has slowed from its so lid rate in the fourth quarter.  Payroll employment
was little changed in February, but  job gains have been solid, on average, in
recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low.  Rec ent indicators
point to slower growth of hous ehold spending and business fixed  investment in
the first quarter.  On a 12-mont h basis, overall inflation has declined, largely as a
result of lower energy prices; in flation for items other than f ood and energy
remains near 2 percent.  On balan ce, market-based measures of i nflation
compensation have remained low in recent months, and survey-bas ed measures of
longer-term inflati on expectations are  little changed.
2.Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum
employment and price stability.  I n support of the se goals, the Committee decided
to maintain the target range fo r the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent.
The Committee continues to view  sustained expansion of economic activity,
strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committe e’s symmetric 2
percent objective as the most likely outcomes.  In light of global economic and
financial developments and mute d inflation pressures, the Commi ttee will be
patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal
funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes.
3.In determining the timing and size  of future adjustments to the  target range for the
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expe cted economic
conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its  symmetric 2
percent inflation objective.  Thi s assessment will take into account a wide range
of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of
inflation pressures and inflati on expectations, and readings on  financial and
international developments.

 THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
Economic Conditions and Outlook  
 Data received in recent weeks suggest that the risk of a pronou nced slowing of the 
economy has diminished.  The staff now estimates that real GDP in the first quarter 
rose at an annual rate of 2.1 per cent; this estimate is about 1  percentage point higher 
than projected in the March T ealbook, as data on housing, state  and local 
construction, and net exports  came in stronger than antic ipated.  Moreover, retail 
sales, after declining in Febru ary, bounced back in the followi ng month, reflecting 
delayed tax refunds that pushed s ome February spending into March.  Household 
spending and business fixed invest ment are estimated to have sl owed in the first 
quarter, consistent with the exp ectation that GDP growth is ste pping down from its 
strong pace in 2018.  For the current year as a whole, GDP is p rojected to grow at a 
rate little above the growt h rate of potential output. 
 Available data indicate that the  labor market remains strong. 
o After the weakness in February, payrolls rose by 196,000 in March.  Given the 
very strong figures for January, pa yroll gains averaged a solid 180,000 per 
month for the first quarter, well above the pace that the staff  estimates to be 
consistent with no change i n resource u tilization. 
o The labor force participa tion rate ticked down to 63.0 percent in March, while 
the unemployment rate stayed a t 3.8 percent.  Although the unem ployment 
rate remains below all particip ants’ estimates of the longer-ru n rate of 
unemployment in the March Summary of Economic Projections, policymakers do not expect high le vels of labor u tilization to generate notable 
upward pressure on inflation. 
o Average hourly earnings rose 3.2 percent over the 12 months end ing in 
March, up from 2.8 percent a year e arlier.  The Federal Reserve  Bank of 
Atlanta’s wage growth tracker a lso had a higher reading than a year earlier, 
but none of these rates suggest that the labor market is overheating. 
 Headline and core PCE inflati on rates have declined and are run ning below the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective .  Inflation is expected to move  up later this year, as 
the effects of idiosyncratic a nd temporary factors that are cur rently holding down 
inflation dissipate. 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
April 25, 2019
Page 11 of 36

oThe staff estimates the 12-month change in core PCE prices at 1 .6 percent for
March, reflecting in pa rt unusual and notable declines in a few  categories.
Staff projects 12-month core  inflation to sta y around 1.6 percent before
moving up by the end of the summer.  For 2019 as a whole, core PCE prices
are expected to increase 1.8 percen t.  Thereafter, core price inflation is
expected to edge up to 1 .9 percent in 2020 and 2021.  12-month headline
inflation is expected to run close  to core inflation over the p rojection period.
oIndicators of inflation expect ations are little changed, on balance, since the
March Tealbook and suggest that lo ng-term inflation expectation s remain
well-anchored.
Increases in equity prices and declines in cor porate-bond yield s and spreads have
continued to produce easier fin ancing conditions for businesses and households.
Although downside risks have dimini shed somewhat, several persist.
oThe factors that have caused the decline in inflation may turn out to be more
persistent than the staff currently projects.  In addition, ind icators of longer-
term inflation expecta tions bear watching.
oThe possibility that softer hous ehold and business spending wil l turn out to be
more persistent poses downside risks for economic activity.
oThe staff has revised up its proj ection for economic growth in emerging
market economies, although growt h in advanced foreign economies is likely
to languish in the near  term.  Notably, soft euro-area data, es pecially in
manufacturing, may be signa ling more pronounced weakness.
oWhile a “no-deal, no-transition” B rexit seems to have been avoi ded for now,
the prolonged uncertainty associat ed with the Brexit process wi ll weigh on
investment and spending in the U nited Kingdom.  Furthermore, de spite
reported progress towards a U.S.-China trade agreement, the out comes of the
ongoing negotiations remain uncertain.
Policy Strategy 
Policymakers may have anticipat ed a moderation in overall outpu t growth from
2018 to 2019, and see the first-quarte r dip in estimated growth  of household and
business spending as transitory.  Consequently, they may antici pate a rebound in
spending over the remainder of  2019 and therefore continue to s ee economic
Alternatives

conditions evolving broadly in lin e with their expectations, no twithstanding notable 
risks. 
Policymakers may interpret the de cline in inflation as having b een caused largely or
entirely by idiosyncratic and temporary factors.  Thus, policym akers may be
confident that, under the current  monetary policy stance, infla tion will rise to the
Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term.
oPolicymakers may also anticipate that price pressures from reso urce
utilization will facili tate the return of inflation to 2 percen t.
oIn addition, they may judge long-te rm inflation expectations to  be
sufficiently well-anchored to w ithstand the temporary decline i n inflation.
Seeing muted inflation pressures in the context of near-potential growth and the
policy rate within the range of estimates of its neutral level,  policymakers may deem
the current stance of policy as appropriate.
Market quotes along with responses t o the Desk’s latest surveys of primary dealers
and market participants indicate t hat a change in the target ra nge at the May meeting
is seen as very unlikely.  A statem ent such as Alternative B al so appears generally in
line with the expectations of respondents to the Desk’s surveys .  Consequently, a
statement along the lines of Alte rnative B seems unlikely to ge nerate appreciable
changes in asset prices.

Monetary  Policy Expectations  and Uncertainty  
Measures  of the expected  path of the federal funds rate based  on financial 
market prices moved down a bit, on net, over the intermeeting  period.  Early in 
the period, policy expectations  declined  notably in reaction to FOMC 
communications  following  the March meeting,  including  the larger‐than‐
expected  downward  revisions  to FOMC  participants’  March SEP  assessments  for

rate.  These declines were partly reversed  later in the period as 
U.S. and Chinese data were, on  balance, stronger  than expected  and as 
sentiment  improved  regarding  trade negotiations  between the  United States and 
China.  Compared  with the March surveys,  respondents  to the Desk’s April/Ma y 
surveys revised down their

shift since March towards lower outcomes,  leaving only marginal  probability  on 
outcomes  above the current target range.   By comparison,  Desk survey 
respondents  on average assigned  the greatest  probability  to an unchanged  year‐
end target range  and judged the odds on higher rates as slightly outweighing  
those on lower rates (not shown).

months’ time with virtual ce rtain ty.  By the time of the January  meeting, 
however,  substantial  probability  of an unchanged  or lower future target range 
had emerged.   At the January  meeting the FOMC indicated  it would take a 
“patient”  approach going  forward.   Between the  January and March meetings, 
the implied probability  that the policy rate would be unchanged at  the six‐month  
horizon—which  can be interpreted  as one measure  of perceived  patience—rose 
significantly.   Since March,  the implied probability  of no change in the target

the federal funds rate of  about 20 to 25 basis points per year over the next

Adjusting  for term

negative

longer‐run forecast  from the December  Blue Chip  survey (the yellow diamonds)

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
If policymakers judge that the softening in inflation indicates  an increased risk of 
inflation running persistentl y below the 2 percent objective, t hey may want to 
communicate that they stand ready to adjust rates.  With Altern ative A, the Committee 
would signal the potential for rate cuts in the near term by st ating that, in light of 
“softening” inflation, it will “assess whether it may soon beco me appropriate to adjust the 
target range for the federal f unds rate.”  Under Alternative A,  the “patient” language used 
in Alternative B would be removed. 
Policymakers may judge that solid  job growth and gradually firm ing wage data 
indicate that the labor market  strengthened at a steady pace ov er the past few years 
without generating a sizable increase in inflation.  Meanwhile,  recent data suggest that 
the growth rates of household a nd business spending have been s lowing from their pace 
last year.  With inflation already running below the Committee’ s symmetric 2 percent 
objective, policymakers may see significant risks that inflatio n could fail to return to 
2 percent on a sustained basis, pa rticularly if resource utiliz ation were to soften.  In this 
case, the credibility of the Com mittee’s commitment to its 2 pe rcent longer-run inflation 
objective could be damaged or longe r-term inflation expectations may erode. 
In addition, policymakers may deem  it prudent to emphasize their commitment to 
support a sustained return of inflation to the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective.  
Consequently, Alternative A stresses that adjustments to the ta rget range may be 
“appropriate” to support the outco me of “inflation near the Com mittee’s symmetric 
2 percent objective.” 
While Alternative A signals an inclination to reduce the target  range in the future, 
the inclusion of the phrase “a ssess whether it may soon become appropriate to adjust the 
target range” does not lock the Committee into making such an a djustment.  Hence, the 
Committee may see this communication as reducing the risk of a policy surprise while 
preserving optionality for a future rate reduction.  
A statement from the Committee su ch as Alternative A could be seen by market 
participants as signaling a more accommodative path for the pol icy rate than had been 
anticipated and market  expectations for the federal funds rate would likely fall.  If, in 
addition, market participants judg ed Alternative A as indicatin g a more accommodative 
policy reaction functi on, then equity prices and inflation compensation would likely rise.

 The effect on the dollar might be more ambiguous, with lower re al rates and higher future 
inflation pointing to deprecia tion, but stronger economic activity suggesting the opposite.  
If, by contrast, market participan ts inferred from Alternative A that the Committee had 
lowered its outlook for economic activity and inflation, equity  prices would likely fall 
together with the exchange valu e of the dollar, and possibly in flation compensation. 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C  
Alternative C provides a possible template for a statement the Committee could 
consider in circumstances in which the economy continues to perform well and the case 
for further increases in the ta rget range for t he federal funds rate has materially 
strengthened.  Because Alternativ e C is primarily meant to spur  thinking on future 
statement language in circumstan ces different from those curren tly prevailing, it omits 
the usual discussion of recent data in the first paragraph.  Pr esumably, at a time when 
Alternative C became appropriate, the language of the first par agraph would convey a 
view of firming inflation, a str engthening economy, or diminish ed risks to the outlook; it 
is also possible that one or more of these signals would be in postmeeting statements 
prior to the removal of the “patient” language.  
If policymakers see a growing likelihood for another increase in the target range, 
the language characterizing the C ommittee’s approach as “patien t” would need to change.  
The March Tealbook offered two possibilities for altering this language.  The first was to simply delete the last senten ce of the second paragraph, and th e second was to replace 
that sentence with the thought that “some further policy firmin g may become 
appropriate.”  The current version of Alternative C takes a sli ghtly different approach by 
modifying the last sentence of  the second paragraph to identify  the economic conditions 
that may justify a subsequent inc rease in the target range.  In  particular, Alternative C 
states: “In light of [firmer inf lation readings | tightening re source utilizatio n | diminished 
risks to the outlook], the Comm ittee will assess whether it may  soon become appropriate 
to adjust the target range f or the federal funds rate.”  
Policymakers may see this stateme nt as addressing a need to pro vide more clarity 
about the future course of po licy than is given by simply delet ing the sentence containing 
the “patient” language.  While the  sentence indicates a bias toward an increase in the 
target range in the future, the language does not commit to such an adjustment.  As with 
Alternative A, the Committee ma y view this comm unication as red ucing the risk of a 
surprise change in policy, while c reating optionality for future rate hikes.

 Implementation Note for May 2019 (all Alternatives)   
Release Date:  May 1, 2019 
Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation  
The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy 
stance announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on March 20, 
2019 May 1, 2019: 
 The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted [ unanimously ] 
to maintain the interest rate pa id on required and excess reser ve balances at 
2.40 percent , effective March 21, 2019 May 2, 2019.   
 As part of its policy decision, the F ederal Open Market Committee voted to 
authorize and direct the Open Mar ket Desk at the Federal Reserv e Bank of 
New York, until instructed otherw ise, to execute transactions i n the System 
Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic p olicy 
directive: 
“Effective March 21, 2019 May 2, 2019, the Federal Open Market 
Committee directs the Desk to unde rtake open market operations as 
necessary to maintain the federal  funds rate in a target range of 2-1/4 to  
2-1/2 percent, including overnight  reverse repurchase operation s (and 
reverse repurchase operations w ith maturities of m ore than one day when 
necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 2.25 percent, in amounts li mited only 
by the value of Treasury securi ties held outright in the System  Open 
Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per-
counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. 
Effective May 2, 2019, the Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling 
over at auction the amount of prin cipal payments from the Federal 
Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities maturing during each calendar 
month that exceeds $30 $15 billion .  , and The Committee directs the 
Desk  to continue reinvesting in agency mortgage-backed securities the 
amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holding s of 
agency debt and agency mortgage-b acked securities received duri ng each 
calendar month that exceeds $20 billion.  Small deviations from  these 
amounts for operational reasons are acceptable. 
The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll an d coupon 
swap transactions as necessary t o facilitate settlement of the Federal 
Reserve’s agency mortgage-back ed securities transactions.” 
 In a related action, the Board of  Governors of the Federal Rese rve System 
voted [ unanimously ] to approve the establishment of the primary credit rate 
at the existing lev el of 3.00 percent.

Balance Sheet and Income Projections 
The staff has prepared projecti ons of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the 
associated income statement th at are consistent with the baseli ne forecast i n Tealbook A.  
These projections are substantial ly revised from those presente d in the previous Tealbook 
for two principal reasons.   
First, the staff’s revised financial projections in Tealbook A imply a much flatter 
path for the federal funds rate relative to the March Tealbook,  with the short-term policy 
rate 140 basis points lower at the  end of the medium term, in 2 021:Q4.  Over the medium 
run, the paths for the 10-year T reasury yield and the 30-year f ixed mortgage rate are both, 
on average, 50 basis points belo w the March Tealbook projection .  As a result of these 
revisions to the forecast, the  projected path of prepayments fr om agency mortgage-
backed securities (MBS) is highe r, which induces a steeper pace  of decline in SOMA 
MBS holdings throughout t he projection horizon.   
Second, the projections incorporat e new policy assumptions rega rding the 
evolution of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, which embed the Balance Sheet 
Normalization Principles and Pla ns released after the March FOM C meeting.  Over the 
current quarter and the next, the se plans lead to a slower bala nce sheet runoff, which 
comes to a conclusion at the end of September 2019.  After this  date, the size of the 
SOMA portfolio will be held roughly  constant for some time, while allowing for gradual 
declines in reserves to accomm odate growth in currency and othe r nonreserve liabilities.1  
In our projections, we continue t o assume that reserve balances  will decline until they 
reach $1 trillion, which will take  place in the fourth quarter of 2021, nearly two years 
later than in the March Tealbook.2   
                                                 
1 Runoff of Treasury securities is slowed by reducing the cap on monthly redemptions from 
$30 billion to $15 billion beginning in May 2019.  Beginning in October 2019, proceeds from principal 
payments of agency securities w ill be reinvested in Treasury se curities subject to a monthly cap of 
$20 billion, with purchases roughly matching the maturity compo sition of Treasury securities outstanding.  
Principal payments of agency s ecurities in excess of the monthl y cap will continue to be reinvested in 
agency MBS.   
2 Because reserve balances are e xpected to reach $1 trillion lat er than in the previous Tealbook, 
and, thus, at a time when nominal GDP is projected to be at a h igher level, the size of  the balance sheet as a 
share of GDP is projected to be slightly smaller over the longer term.  However, as discussed in the March 
FOMC memo “Transitioning to an Ample Reserves Regime with Lower  Reserves,” the actual level at

 Evolution of the SOMA portfolio.   Under the balance sheet normalization 
program initiated in October  2017 and revised in March 2019, cumulative redemptions 
are projected to reach $747 bill ion by the time the reduction i n the size of SOMA 
holdings concludes at the end of t he third quarter.  Of this total, redemptions of Treasury 
and agency securities will amount to $419 billion and $328 bill ion, respectiv ely (see the 
table in the exhibit “Redempti ons and Reinvestments of SOMA Pri ncipal Payments”).  
Through the same date, cumulative reinvestments of principal payments in Treasury and 
agency securities are projected to be $363 billion and $153 bil lion, respectively.3  
Relative to the March Tealbook, lower redemptions of Treasury securities through the 
third quarter of 2019 and the cor responding higher reinvestments reflect the new policy 
assumptions for the evolution of the balance sheet.  In additio n, the projection for 
cumulative redemptions of agency securities is $10 billion high er than in the March 
Tealbook given the lower projected p aths of longer-term interes t rates and the resulting 
faster pace of MBS prepay ments over coming months. 
By the time the reduction in tot al securities holdings conclude s at the end 
of 2019:Q3, the size of the SOMA portfolio is projected to be slightly above $3.5 trillion, 
consisting of about $2.1 trillion of Treasury securities and $1 .5 trillion in agency 
securities.  At that time, the ba lance sheet is projected to st and at about 17 percent of 
nominal GDP, with nonreserve liabi lities totaling 11 percent (s ee the bottom panels of the 
exhibit titled “Tota l Assets and Selected B alance Sheet Items”).  Starting from the fourth 
quarter of 2021, when reserves are projected to reach $1 trilli on, the size of the balance 
sheet is projected to remain a ne arly 16 percent share of GDP.4  For comparison, the size 
of the balance sheet as a sha re of GDP peaked at about 25 perce nt in the fourth quarter of 
2014 and averaged about 5 percent ov er the decade prior to the crisis.  After reserves 
reach $1 trillion, SOMA holdings a re projected to start rising in line with nominal GDP, 
keeping pace with increases in Fed eral Reserve liabilities and Federal Reserve Bank 
capital.   
                                                 
which the decline in reserves ceases will need to be chosen in light of information on banks’ reserve 
demand. 
3 MBS prepayments are projected  to slightly exceed the $20 billi on per month redemption cap in 
June so that $300 million of reinvestments in agency MBS are pr ojected to occur in that month.  However, 
the projections for agency MBS are subject to considerable unce rtainty because of unscheduled 
prepayments.  In particular, shou ld longer-term interest rates decline significantly from the current 
projected paths, prepayments of MBS are likely to  rise and may more frequently exceed the monthly cap of 
$20 billion.  
4 At that time, the SOMA portfo lio is comprised of about $2.4 tr illion in Treasury securities and 
$1.1 trillion in agency securities.

 The share of agency MBS in the S OMA portfolio, which currently stands at 
42 percent, is expected to decline somewhat more rapidly than projected in the March 
Tealbook, and reach about 19 percent by the end of 2025 given t he higher projected pace 
of MBS prepayments.  
SOMA portfolio characteristics.   The weighted-average  duration of the SOMA 
Treasury portfolio is currentl y about six and a half years (see  the top panel of the exhibit 
titled “Projections for the Chara cteristics of SOMA Treasury Se curities Holdings”).  
Duration is projected to edge  up to nearly seven years as redem ptions continue over this 
quarter and the next and longer-duration securities become a la rger share of the 
portfolio.5  As in the March Tealbook we continue to assume that, once the level of 
reserves reaches $1 trillion, all principal payments received o n maturing Treasury 
securities and on agency securiti es is entirely reinvested in T reasury bills until the share 
of Treasury bills in the Treasury securities portfolio reaches about one-third, close to their 
pre-crisis share.6  This process is expected to t ake about 5 quarters and leads to a sharp 
reduction in the weighted-avera ge duration to just over 5 years .  Thereafter, further 
purchases of Treasury securities are assumed to be spread across the maturity spectrum 
(see the bottom panel  of the exhibit).   
Federal Reserve remittances.   Remittances to the Treasury are projected to 
decline to $49 billion this  year from $65 billion in 2018 (see the exhibit “Income 
Projections”), mainly reflecting t he decline in interest income  resulting from the 
reduction in SOMA securities holdings.7  Total interest expense is projected to be little 
                                                 
5 Consistent with the Desk’s current practice, these projections  assume that rollovers of maturing 
Treasury securities will be allocat ed across newly issued secur ities at Treasury auctions on a pro-rata basis 
in proportion with the amount being issued.  Consistent with th e Desk’s plans for reinvesting principal 
payments from agency debt and MB S into Treasury securities begi nning in October 2019, these projections 
also assume that these purchases  will be made across the Treasu ry curve during each month.  Purchase 
amounts will be allocated to sector s in line with the amounts o utstanding in those sectors.  Secondary-
market purchases of Treasury securities will be distributed acr oss eight sectors for nominal coupon 
securities and one sector each fo r bills, Treasury Inflation-Pr otected Securities (TIPS), and Floating Rate 
Notes (FRNs).  Of note, the shar e of these purchases allocated to bills will be 15 percen t, while the share 
allocated to coupon securities w ith residual maturity shorter t han three years w ill be 41 percent. 
6 Excluding securities acquired through small-value test operati ons, the SOMA portfolio currently 
contains no Treasury bills. 
7 Remittances in 2018 included two mandated transfers to the Tre asury due to reductions to the 
statutory limit on aggregate Reserve Bank surplus.  First, $2.5  billion was transferred in February 2018 
following an amendment to Section 7 of the Federal Reserve Act by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, 
enacted in that month.  Second, $675 million was transferred in  June 2018, reflecting another amendment

 changed at $42 billion this year.8  Remittances are expected to increase to $55 billion in 
2020.  Thereafter, remittances ris e reflecting an increase in i nterest income associated 
with a growing balance sheet. 
Relative to the previous Tealbook, t he projected path for remit tances has been 
revised up over the next few year s and revised down in the long er term.  These revisions 
reflect the differential effects  over time that the revised fin ancial projections have on 
interest expense and interest income.  Over the medium term, re mittances are somewhat 
higher than previously projecte d primarily because the lower pa th for the interest rate 
paid on reserve balances reduces  interest expense.  In the long er term, this effect is more 
than offset by a downward revision to interest income stemming from a shift in the 
composition of the portfolio.  In par ticular, the faster pace o f prepayments from relatively 
higher-yielding MBS res ults in larger reinvestments into lower- yielding Treasury 
securities, thus reducing intere st income.  As shown in the middle right panel of the 
exhibit “Income Projections”, annual remittances are projected to rise gradually from 
around 0.25 percent of nominal GDP next year to just below 0.3 percent by the end of the 
projection horizon.  
Unrealized gains or losses.   The SOMA portfolio was  in a net unrealized gain 
position of about $61 billion at the end of March.  The staff estimates that the SOMA 
portfolio will be in a net unr ealized gain position of about $4 1 billion at the end of April.9  
This amount is attributable  to a $53 billion unrealized gain po sition in Treasury securities 
which more than offsets a $13 bil lion unrealized loss position in agency MBS.  With 
longer-term interest rates proj ected to rise, the unrealized ga in position is expected to turn 
into an unrealized loss position during the second half of 2020 .  The unrealized loss 
position is expected to reach a  peak around $86 billion in 2023 :Q2.  Compared with the 
                                                 
to Section 7 by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Con sumer Protection Act, enacted in 
May 2018.  
8 We continue to assume that the FOMC will set a 25 -basis-point-wide target range for the federal 
funds rate throughout the projection period.  Consistent with t he FOMC’s December 2018 Implementation 
Note, we assume that the interest rates paid on reserve balance s will be set 10 basis points below the top of 
the target range.  We continue to assume that the offering rate  on overnight RRPs will be set at the bottom 
of the range.  
9 See the Tealbook B box titled “W hat Does it Mean for the SOMA Portfolio to be in an 
‘Unrealized Loss’ Position?” (Jun e 2018) for an explanation of the accounting notions  of unrealized and 
realized gain and loss positions , as well as their implications  for the Federal Reserve’s ability to meet its 
obligations.

 March Tealbook, the path for the  unrealized position of the SOM A portfolio is generally 
higher reflecting the lower proj ections for longer-term interes t rates.  
Total term premium effect :  SOMA securities holdings are estimated to be 
reducing the term premium embe dded in the 10-year Treasury yiel d by about 131 basis 
points in the current quarter (s ee the exhibit “P rojections for  the 10-year Treasury Total 
Term Premium Effect”).   Relative to the Mar ch projection, the level of this total term 
premium effect (TTPE) is sligh tly more negative over the coming  year, but it is slightly 
less negative over th e longer term.  
Over the next year, the downwar d effect on the TTPE resulting f rom the slower 
pace of securities redemptions and larger SOMA holdings more th an offsets the upward 
effect stemming from faster MBS  prepayments due to the revised financial assumptions, 
thereby leading to a  slightly more negative TTPE.  However, by the end of 2021, the 
effect of the slower pace of s ecurities redemptions fades, and,  through the end of the 
projection horizon, a slightly le ss negative TTPE results from the projected more rapid 
shift in the composition of the por tfolio from MBS towards Trea sury securities arising 
from the lower path for l onger-term interest rates.10,11  
                                                 
10 The lower path of longer-term in terest rates, which induces fa ster MBS prepayments and higher 
reinvestments of MBS proceeds into Treasury securities, leads t o a shift in the compos ition of the portfolio 
from MBS towards Treasury secur ities.  Shifts of such nature re duce the projected magnitude of the TTPE, 
because in the term-structure m odel on which the TTPE estimates  are based MBS holdings are measured at 
par value, whereas Treasury secu rities are measured on a 10-yea r equivalents basis. 
11 The slightly less negative path of the TTPE is also due, in pa rt, to the smaller size of the balance 
sheet relative to GDP i n the longer run.
