Monetary Policy Alternatives 
Information received since the Committee’s May meeting indicate s that economic 
growth has stepped down to a moderate rate.  Although household  spending appears to 
have picked up from earlier in the year, indicators of business  fixed investment have been 
soft in the second quarter.  In contrast, recent employment data indicate that the labor 
market has remained strong.  The une mployment rate declined to 3.6 percent in April and 
remained at this value in Ma y.  Although job gains slowed to 75 ,000 in May, the three-
month average of 151,000 remains well above estimates of the rate consistent with no 
change in labor utilization.  The  staff now projects real GDP g rowth to decline from a 
pace of 2½ percent in the first half of this year to around 1¾ percent in the second half, in 
contrast to the moderate ste p-up in growth over 2019 projected in the April Tealbook.  
Core PCE prices rose by 1.6 per cent over the 12 months ending in April, and staff 
projects 12-month core PCE infl ation to move up over the second  half of 2019.  The 
escalation of international trade tensions in recent weeks has left a significant imprint on 
financial markets.  Treasury yields and the market-implied path  for the policy rate shifted 
down considerably over the int ermeeting period, while equity pr ices declined and credit 
spreads widened.  Against thi s backdrop, along with greater unc ertainties about the 
foreign outlook, the staff has sh ifted to the downside its asse ssment of the balance of 
risks associated with its pro jection for economic activity. 
Under these circumstances, the  alternative policy statements presented below 
offer a range of options for the s tance and likely future path of monetary policy.  
Alternative B mainta ins the current monetary policy stance and continues to indicate that 
the Committee views sustained expansion of economic activity, s trong labor market 
conditions, and inflation near the  Committee’s symmetric 2 perc ent objective as the most 
likely outcomes.  However, this al ternative points to increased  uncertainties about the 
outlook, along with muted inflation pressures, as reasons for a ltering the policy message. 
In particular, the statement move s away from the “patient” appr oach to monetary policy 
articulated in this  year’s previous postmeeting statements and expresses the Committee’s 
willingness to act as appropriate to sustain the economic expan sion. 
Alternative A gives a similar assessment of the incoming data as Alternative B, 
but views heightened concerns abou t the outlook as sufficient t o merit a policy response.  
Accordingly, this alternative lo wers the target range for the f ederal funds rate by ¼

 percentage point and announces t he conclusion of the reduction of the Federal Reserve’s 
securities holdings  by the end of July.  With this easing, as w ell as expressing the 
Committee’s preparedness to adjus t the monetary policy stance further, Alternative A 
maintains the positive economi c outlook given in the May statem ent.  
Alternative C mainta ins the current policy stance and reinforce s the policy 
message from recent FOMC meetin gs.  In particular, it retains the “patient” approach to 
monetary policy from the May postmeeting statement and leaves the description of the 
outlook unchanged.  Thus, Alternative C implicitly discounts re cent concerns about trade 
and other risks, suggesting these developments have little bear ing on the policy outlook.   
With regard to the specifics of the language in Alternatives A,  B, and C: 
 The assessment of the incoming data: 
o Alternatives A and B share the s ame characterization of the inc oming data.  
Both alternatives continue to portr ay the labor market as stron g, and note that 
the unemployment rate remains l ow, and that average job gains i n recent 
months have been “solid.”  Wh ile both alternatives describe eco nomic growth 
as moderate, they acknowledge dive rgent developments in househo ld and 
business spending by noting that “although growth of household spending 
appears to have picked up from earlier in the year, indicators of business fixed 
investment have been soft.”  B oth alternatives also note that “ overall inflation 
and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 
2 percent.”  Regarding indicators  of inflation ex pectations, Al ternatives A and 
B state that “market-based measures of inflation compensation h ave declined” 
and repeat the assessment from the May postmeeting statement th at “survey-
based measures of longer-term inf lation expectations are little  changed.” 
o Alternative C has two modifications to the  description of incom ing data 
compared with Alternatives A a nd B.  First, Alternative C chara cterizes 
private-sector spending in a more neutral manner by omitting “a lthough” and 
stating that “growth of househol d spending appears to have picked up from 
earlier in the year, while indica tors of business fixed investm ent have been 
soft.”  Second, regarding inflation expectations, Alternative C  does not point 
to the decline in market-based m easures of inflation compensati on, but 
continues to describe them as having remained low.

  The outlook for economic activity and inflation: 
o Under all three alternatives, the modal outlook for economic ac tivity and 
inflation is unchanged from the May FOMC statement.  However, t o achieve 
the outcomes of “sustained expa nsion of economic activity, strong labor 
market conditions, and inflation ne ar the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent 
objective,” the alternatives convey different paths for the fed eral funds rate.  
In addition, under Alternatives A  and B, the Committee would ac knowledge 
that uncertainties about this outlook have increased.  
 For the current policy decision and the outlook for policy: 
o Alternatives B and C maintain the  current target range for the federal funds 
rate.  In contrast, Alternative A lowers the target range “in l ight of heightened 
uncertainties about the economi c outlook and muted inflation pressures” and 
states the Committee’s decisi on “to conclude the reduction of i ts aggregate 
securities holdings in the System Open Market Account at the end of July.”  
o With Alternative B, the Committee would replace the indication that it will be 
“patient” with the statement t hat, in light of uncertainties about the economic 
outlook and the softness in infla tion, it “will act as appropri ate to sustain the 
expansion, with a strong labor m arket and inflation near its sy mmetric 2 
percent objective.” 
o Given the adjustment to the tar get range, Alternative A also no  longer 
contains the “patient” language  with regard to the policy stanc e; instead, it 
signals that the Committee is prep ared to make further adjustme nts to the 
policy stance. 
o By contrast, Alternative C con tinues to highlight “global econo mic and 
financial developments and mute d inflation pressures” as factors that the 
Committee is focused on, but it reta ins the “patient” language,  indicating that 
at this point these developmen ts do not warrant a change in the policy outlook.

 MAY 2019  FOMC  STATEMENT  
1. Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in March 
indicates that the labor marke t remains strong and that economi c activity rose at a 
solid rate.  Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent m onths, and the 
unemployment rate has remain ed low.  Growth of household spendi ng and 
business fixed investment slowe d in the first quarter.  On a 12 -month basis, 
overall inflation and inflati on for items other than food and e nergy have declined 
and are running below 2 percent .  On balance, market-based meas ures of inflation 
compensation have remained low in recent months, and survey-bas ed measures of 
longer-term inflati on expectations are  little changed.  
 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum 
employment and price stability.  I n support of the se goals, the Committee decided 
to maintain the target range fo r the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent.  
The Committee continues to view  sustained expansion of economic activity, 
strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committe e’s symmetric 2 
percent objective as the most likely outcomes.  In light of global economic and 
financial developments and mute d inflation pressures, the Commi ttee will be 
patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal 
funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes.  
3. In determining the timing and size  of future adjustments to the  target range for the 
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expe cted economic 
conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its  symmetric 2 
percent inflation objective.  Thi s assessment will take into account a wide range 
of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of 
inflation pressures and inflati on expectations, and readings on  financial and 
international developments.

uncertainties about the economic outlook and muted inflation pr essures, the 
Committee decided to maintain lower  the target range for the federal funds rate at 
to 2 to  2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent.  The Committee also decided to conclude the 
reduction of its aggregate securi ties holdings in the System Op en Market 
Account at the end of July; thereafter, reinvestments will occu r as specified 
in the Committee’s statement of Balance Sheet Normalization Pri nciples and 
Plans.   With these actions,  the Committee continues to view sustained expansion 
of economic activity, strong la bor market conditions, and infla tion near the 
Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely ou tcomes.  In light 
of global economic and financial  developments and muted inflati on pressures, 
The Committee will be patient as it determines what future is prepared to

 THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
Economic Conditions and Outlook  
 The staff estimates that real GDP in the second quarter rose at  an annual rate of 
1.8 percent, about 1 percentage point below its pace in the fir st quarter.  Although 
household spending is estimated to have picked up in the curren t quarter from earlier 
in the year, business fixed investment looks to have stalled.  The staff revised down 
GDP growth for the second half of the year, as heightened conce rns about global 
trade and an associated deteriora tion in risk sentiment are exp ected to weigh on the 
business sector.  Nonetheless, for the current year as a whole,  GDP is projected to 
increase at a rate slightly a bove the growth rate of potential output. 
 Available data indicate that the  labor market remains strong. 
o Payrolls rose 75,000 in May and averaged 151,000 per month over  the past 
three months, roughly 30,000 per mont h lower than expected at the time of the 
April Tealbook.  Nevertheless, ave rage payroll gains in the pas t three months 
are still well above the pace that the staff estimates to be co nsistent with no 
change in resour ce utilization. 
o The labor force participation r ate fell to 62.8 percent in Apri l and remained at 
this value in May.  After declin ing to 3.6 percent in April, th e unemployment 
rate held steady in May.  Although the unemployment rate remain ed below all 
participants’ estimates of the  longer-run normal rate of unempl oyment in the 
March Summary of Economic Projections, in those projections policymakers 
did not expect high levels of labor  utilization to be associated with notable 
upward pressure on inflation. 
o Average hourly earnings rose 3.1 percent over the 12 months ending in May.  While this figure is up from 2.9 percent a year earlier, it is down a bit from the 
readings earlier this year. 
 Headline and core PCE inflation rates are running below the Com mittee’s 2 percent 
objective.  Inflation is expected  to move up later this year, as the effects of 
idiosyncratic and temporary fact ors that have held down inflati on dissipate. 
o The 12-month change in core PCE  prices stood at 1.6 percent in April.
1  Staff 
projects core inflation to m ove up by the end of the summer and  reach 
                                                            
1 Based on PPI and CPI data receive d for May, the staff’s estima tes for the 12-month change in 
headline and core PCE inflation in May are both 1.5 percent.

 1.8 percent for the year as a whol e.  Core inflation is expecte d to edge up to 
1.9 percent in 2020 and 2021.  Headline inflation on a 12-month  basis is 
expected to run below core i nflation by 0.3 percen tage point th is year.  
Beyond this year, headline inflation is expected to be close to  core inflation. 
o While survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectatio ns are little 
changed and on their own suggest that these expectations remain  reasonably 
well-anchored, market-based meas ures of inflation compensation have 
declined by more than 20 basis poi nts from already low levels. 
 Investor sentiment towards ris ky assets deteriorated as a resul t of the recent escalation 
of trade tensions.  Treasury yiel ds and the market-implied path  for the policy rate 
shifted down considerably, while e quity prices declined and credit spreads and the 
exchange value of the dollar in creased.  The uncertainties surr ounding trade policy 
developments, particularly if th ey are sustained or intensify, may have negative 
implications for the economic outlook.     
 Other sources of downside risk stem from abroad.  Recent data o n foreign economic 
activity has generall y been disappointing, raising questions ab out the strength of the 
global economy.  More specific ri sks include the increased prob ability of a “no deal” 
Brexit and renewed concerns about the sustainability of Italy’s  public debt.   
 In light of these developments, t he staff now judges that the risks to its projection for 
GDP growth are tilted to the  downside over the next year. 
Policy Strategy 
 Although policymakers may see conti nued strong labor market conditions and a 
gradual rise of inflation to 2 per cent as the most likely outco me, they may concur 
with the staff assessment that downside risks to this outlook h ave increased.  In light 
of heightened risks, and in a context in which inflationary pre ssures remain muted, 
they may deem it prudent to leave the target range unchanged at  the June meeting but 
to indicate that they will act as appropriate to sustain the ex pansion.  Hence, 
Alternative B removes the “pat ient” language used in the May FO MC statement. 
 While acknowledging the recent increase in uncertainties about the economic 
outlook, policymakers may not want to adjust the policy stance at the June meeting, 
preferring instead to await the ar rival of additional information, such as the outcome 
of upcoming trade negotiations, that can inform their judgment about the appropriate 
stance of policy.  Moreover, both survey information and market pricing suggests that 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
June 13, 2019

Authorized for Public Release
a reduction in the target range f or the federal funds rate at t his meeting would be 
somewhat surprising and therefo re could have an adverse effect on market sentiment 
if investors judged that the Committee was especially concerned  about the outlook.  
Market quotes, along with responses  to the Desk’s latest survey s of primary dealers
and market participants, indicate  that a change in the target r ange at the June meeting
is seen as unlikely.  Some market commentary and responses in t he Desk’s surveys
suggest that a change in the po licy message in the June stateme nt is expected,
consistent with recent communications from policymakers.  That said, several
respondents to the Desk’s survey s expect little change in langu age, whereas a few
respondents expect downside risks to be more explicitly mention ed, and others did
not provide much information on the ir statement expectations.  Consequently, a
statement along the lines of Alternative B appears reasonably c onsistent with the
current market-implied path for t he federal funds rate.  Howeve r, given the apparent
dispersion of views, predicting the market reaction is particularly difficult at this time.

   Monetary  Policy Expectations  and Uncertainty  
Measures  of the expected  path of the federal funds rate based  on financial market prices 
declined sharply over the  intermeeting  period.  Negative  headlines  about international  
trade tensions,  weaker‐ than‐expected  domestic economic  news, and, later in  the period, 
remarks by  FOMC participants  that were seen as signaling  an increased  likelihood  of near‐
term policy easing were the primary drivers of  the declines.   Respondents  to the Desk’s 
June surveys also revised
 down their federal funds  rate projections  when compared  with 
the April/May  surveys. 
The probability  distribution  of the federal funds rate following  the June 2019 meeting, as  
implied by a straight read  of the most recent quotes  on options and not adjusted  for risk 
premiums (not  shown), suggests  that investors  continue  to assign  low odds to a 
decrease  in 
the target range  for the federal funds  rate at the  June meeting.   In contrast,  
the distribution  of possible values for the funds rate  following  the July meeting (figure 1) 
now implies a 25‐ basis‐point decline  in the target rang e 
is the most likely outcome.   The 
probability  distribution  has shifted notably since the May  FOMC meeting towards lower 
outcomes,  leaving only a modest  probability  that the federal funds  rate will stay  in its 
current target range.  For comparison,  a third of the respondents  to  the June Desk 
surveys provided  modal expectations  for either a 25‐  or 50‐basis‐point decline in the 
target range  at the July  meeting.   Figure 2 shows that the option‐ implied probability  
distribution  for the end  of 2019 also shifted down substantially.1  It suggests  that the 
federal funds  rate is about equally likely to end the year in either the 1.5 to 1.75  percent or 
1.75 to 2 percent range, with only  about a ten percent  probability  on higher values.  By  
contrast,  although respondents  to the June Desk surveys now assign substantially  higher 
probability  to a decline  in the target range  by year‐ end than they did in 
the previous  
surveys, they still see a 42 percent likelihood  that the target range will not  be lowered 
between now  and the end of this year. 
Financial market measures  of the expected  federal funds  rate over  the next few  years 
(figure 3) also declined  substantially  over the  intermeeting  period.  The changes  in near‐
term forward rates  derived
 from overnight index  swaps (OIS) quotes were the largest for 
any intermeeting  period since December  2008.  Forward  rates for end‐2019 and end‐2020 
declined by 41 and 46 basis points, respectively  (the blue lines).  Movements  in the 
expected  federal funds  rate path  adjust ed 
for term premiums using  a staff term structure 
model (the  purple lines) declined  by 33 and 40 basis points for end‐2019 and end‐2020, 
respectively, thus  attributing  most of the changes in forward rates  to changes  in policy 
expectations.2 
1 Furthermore,  option‐ based measures  of uncertainty  about  the federal funds rate, at horizons of 6‐ 
and 12‐months ahead, increased  noticeably.  
2 Figure 3 shows the estimates  for the staff’s updated model, which  is discussed  in the box 
“Revision  to the Staff’s Term‐Premium‐ Adjusted  Policy  Rate Path” in the Financial Market section of

While figure 3 focuses  on changes in forward rates  over the  intermeeting  period, figure 4 
compares  the current level  of the expected  federal funds  rate path  according  to various 
measures.   The straight read of OIS  forward rates, plotted again in blue, suggests  that 
investors  currently  expect the  federal funds  rate to decline 60  basis points by end‐2019 
and a further  33 basis points by end‐2020.  For comparison,  the latest path  from the 
staff’s term structure model, plotted  again in purple,  suggests  that investors  expect 
declines of 32 basis points by end‐2019 and an additional  3 basis points by end‐2020.  An 
alternative  staff model of  the term‐premium  (in green) lies  closer to the unadjusted  
forward rate path,  suggesting  a decline of  a bit less than  50 basis points by end‐2019 and 
another 20 basis points by end‐2020.3  Likewise, the  modal path reported  by the median 
respondent  to the Desk’s June surveys now points to a 50‐basis ‐point decline in 2019,  but 
then a flat path  thereafter  (the brown diamonds).4 
Figure 5 shows the median and  interquartile  range of respondents’  modal federal funds 
rate projections  from the Desk’s June surveys (in blue) relative to the April/May  surveys 
(in green).   The median projections  (the orange bars) for end‐2019 declined  by 50 basis 
points and the interquartile range,  which was essentially  zero in April/May, widened  to 
about 50 basis points.  These changes were predominantly  due to downward  revisions  by 
respondents  in the Survey of Market Participants,  as most respondents  in the Survey of 
Primary Dealers continue  to project no  rate changes for this year.   The interquartile 
ranges for end‐2020 and end‐2021 moved down, while the  median  for the longer‐run 
modal projection  declined  25 basis points.  In explaining  their downward  revisions, most  
respondents  pointed to increased  downside  risks to the economic  outlook,  with several 
pointing to the likely  impact of  trade tensions.  
Figure 6 shows measures  of the longer‐run expected  federal funds  rate.  A straight read 
of forward rates  implied by Treasury yields suggests  that investors’  current expectation 
for the average federal funds  rate 5 to 10 years ahead (the blue line)  declined to about  
2.4 percent.  Adjusting  for term premiums using various staff term structure models 
(with the  light‐red‐shaded region showing  a range of  three such model  estimates) 
continues  to suggest that  5‐to‐10‐year‐ ahead expectations  are above the unadjusted  
forward rates,  at between  2.9 and 3.2 percent,  consistent  with a negative  term premium  
at those horizons.5  In contrast,  surveys of professional  forecasters  project rates  closer to  
the unadjusted  forward rates;  the median forecast  from the Desk’s June surveys (the 
green diamonds)  and the average longer‐run forecast  from the June Blue Chip  survey 
(conducted  through May 24, the yellow diamonds) are  2.5 and 2.75 percent. Both 
declined relative to their previous  readings in April and  in December  of last year, 
respectively.  
3 The box “A Macro‐Finance Measure  of Term Premiums  in Federal  Funds Futures Rates” in the 
Financial Market section of the April 2019 Tealbook  A discusses  the alternative  model. 
4 The most likely timing  of the declines during the remainder  of this year imply 25‐basis‐point 
declines  at the September  and December  FOMC meetings.  
5 Relative to the chart  shown in previous editions of this box, the range of estimates  is narrower  for 
the most recent years.  The upper  part of the range is lower as it now  reflects the estimates  from the

 THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
If policymakers view the escalat ion of trade tensions and the d eterioration in 
investor sentiment as evidence that downside risks for economic  growth have 
significantly increased and are  worried about the ongoing softness in inflation, they may 
deem it appropriate to provide  monetary policy accommodation at  this time to sustain the 
economic expansion.  Moreover, a weakening of the economic expansion in an 
environment in which short-ter m interest rates are not very far  from the effective lower 
bound could warrant a prompt easing of policy on risk-managemen t grounds.  With 
Alternative A, policymakers would communicate that, in light of  “heightened 
uncertainties about the economi c outlook and muted inflation pressures,” the Committee 
“decided to lower the target rang e for the federal funds rate” and “to conclude the 
reduction of its aggregate secu rities holdings.”  Although the economic effects of ending 
the balance sheet runoff in July a s opposed to September are likely trivial, policymakers 
may not want to move their policy tools in opposite directions.   
Policymakers may see the slowing in business fixed investment a nd 
manufacturing output from their rates of increase last year as evidence that trade 
uncertainties, besides leaving a significant imprint on financial markets, are affecting global growth and the U.S. economic outlook.  They may also be concerned about the 
continued decline in Treasury term spreads and view recent move ments as consistent 
with a significant increase i n the probability of a recession o ver the next year if policy 
accommodation is not provided in June.   
With inflation running below the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective, 
policymakers may see significant risks that inflation could fail to return to  2 percent on a 
sustained basis, partic ularly if resource utilization were to s often.  In this case, the 
credibility of the Committee’s commitment to its  2 percent long er-run inflation objective 
could be damaged or longer-term inflation expectations may move  lower. 
In addition, policymakers may deem  it appropriate to emphasize their 
commitment to sustain the economic expansion, support a return of inflation to the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent ob jective, and signal that more  monetary policy 
accommodation may be forthcoming i n the near future.  Consequen tly, in Alternative A, 
the Committee stresses that it “is prepared to adjust the targe t range for the federal funds 
rate” to support these objectives.

 A statement such as Alternativ e A would likely be seen by marke t participants as 
implying a more accommodative pa th for policy than had been anticipated and market 
expectations for the federal f unds rate would likely fall.  If, in addition, market 
participants judged Alternative A as indicating a more accommod ative policy reaction 
function, then equity prices and i nflation compensation would likely rise.  The effect on 
the dollar might be more ambiguous , with lower real rates and higher future inflation 
pointing to depreciation, but s tronger economic activity sugges ting the opposite.  If, by 
contrast, market participants inf erred from Alternative A that the Committee had lowered 
its outlook for economic activity and inflation by more than th ey expect, equity prices 
would likely fall together with the exchange value of the dolla r, and possibly inflation 
compensation. 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C  
If policymakers do not view recent trade and financial market d evelopments as 
significantly increasi ng downside risks to the economic outlook  and are confident that 
economic activity will evolve broa dly in line with their previo us expectations, the 
Committee may want to continue t o signal an intention to “be pa tient as it determines 
what future adjustments to the target range for t he federal fun ds rate may be appropriate.” 
Policymakers may have anticipat ed a moderation in overall outpu t growth from 
2018 to 2019, along with a slowdown in the pace of job gains.  They may see the 
apparent softness in business sp ending as transitory and, with household spending 
picking up from earlier in the year, they may anticipate a rebound in spending over the 
remainder of 2019. 
 Policymakers may interpret the  softness in inflation as being caused largely or 
entirely by transitory factors a nd therefore be confident that,  under the current monetary 
policy stance, inflation will ri se to the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium 
term.  Policymakers may also antic ipate that price pressures fr om high levels of resource 
utilization will facili tate the return of inflation to 2 percen t.  In addition, they may judge 
long-term inflation expectations  to be sufficiently well-anchored at levels consistent with 
the Committee’s 2 percent objective.  They may therefore deem t he current stance of 
policy as appropriate. 
Even though Alternative C would be  consistent with the widely-h eld expectation 
of no change in the target range fo r the federal funds rate at the upcoming meeting, it

 would not signal an increased l ikelihood of adjustments in the monetary policy stance at 
subsequent meetings, as many market participants seem to expect .  As a result, market 
expectations for short-term interest rates would likely move up , while equity prices and 
inflation compensation would lik ely fall.  As was the case last December, the market 
effects could be pronounced if investors judged that the Commit tee was insufficiently 
attentive to downside risks or “inflexible” in its conduct of p olicy.

 IMPLEMENTATION NOTE 
If the Committee decides to maintain the current target range f or the federal funds 
rate, an implementation note th at indicates no change to the Fe deral Reserve’s 
administered rates—the interest rate on required and excess reserve balances, the offering 
rate on overnight reverse repurchase agreements, and the primar y credit rate—would be 
issued.  If the Committee decides to lower the target range for  the federal funds rate, an 
implementation note that communicat es the changes the Federal R eserve decided to make 
in these three policy tools w ould be issued.  Draft implementat ion notes that correspond 
to these two cases appear on the following pages.  If the Commi ttee decides to conclude 
the reduction of its aggregate securities holdings in the Syste m Open Market Account at 
the end of July, the relevant por tions of the directive to the Desk would not need to be 
changed until the July FOMC mee ting.  As usual, struck-out text  indicates language

to 2-1/2 percent, including overnig ht reverse repurchase operat ions (and 
reverse repurchase operations w ith maturities of m ore than one day when 
necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 2.25 2.00 percent, in amounts limited 
only by the value of Treasury secu rities held outright in the S ystem Open 
Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per-
counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. 
Effective May 2, 2019, The Committee directs the Desk to continue  
rolling over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal 
Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities maturing during each calendar

Balance Sheet and Income Projections 
The staff has prepared projecti ons of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the 
associated income statement th at are consistent with the baseli ne forecast in Tealbook A 
and the Balance Sheet Normalization Principles and Plans that t he Commi ttee released  
after the March FOMC meeting.  Ke y features of these projection s are described below.  
If the Committee were to adopt Alternative A at this meeting, b alance sheet reduction 
would conclude at the end of July; this decision would imply only minor changes to the 
projections discussed below.1 
Relative to the April Tealbook, the paths for longer-term inter est rates in the 
staff’s financial projections have been revised down notably.  The 10-year Treasury yield 
and the 30-year fixed mortg
age rate are about 30 to 35 basis po ints lower than in the 
April Tealboo
k over the next three quarters and are both subseq uently about 
15 basis points lower through the end of 2021.  These revisions 
primarily affect the 
balance sheet by implying a faste r pace of prepayments from age ncy mortgage-backed 
securities (MBS) than projected in April, w hich, at this stage
 in the normalization 
process, has
 implications  mostly for the composition rather than the size of the balance 
sheet.
 
Evolution of the SOMA portfolio.  Under the b alance sheet norm alization 
program initiated in October  2017 and revised in March 2019, cumulative redemptions 
are projected to reach $753 bill ion by the tim
e the reduction i n the size of SOMA 
holdings concludes at the end of t he third quarter.  Of this total, redemptions of Treasury 
and agency securities wil l amount to $419 billion and $334 bill ion, respectiv ely (see th
e 
table in the exhibit “Redempti ons and Reinvestments of SOMA Pri ncipal Payments”).  
Over the same per
iod, cum ulative reinvestme nts of principal pay ments in Treasury and 
agency securities are proj
ected to be $363 billion and $159 bil lion, respectively.  Relative 
to the April Tealbook, lower projec ted paths of mortgage rates and the res
ulting faster 
pace of MBS prepayments over co ming months imply both an increa se in projected 
redemptions and a more sustained breach of the $20 billion mont hly redemption cap 
during this summer.  During th
e second and third quarters of th is year, cu mulative 
1 Under Alternative A, the SOMA portfolio remains about $40 bill ion larger from July through the 
end of 2021 than under the base line.  The longer-run size of th e balance sheet as a share of GDP remains 
essentially unchanged as does the degree of downward pressure e xerted by SOMA holdings on longer-term 
Treasury yields.

 redemptions and reinvestments of  agency securities are each $6 billion higher than in the 
April projection. 
By the time the reduction in tot al securities holdings concludes at the end of 
September, the size of the SOMA portfolio is projected to be sl ightly below $3.7 trillion, 
consisting of about $2.1 trillion of Treasury securities and $1 .5 trillion in agency 
securities.  At that time, the ba lance sheet is projected to st and at about 17 percent of 
nominal GDP (see the bottom panels of the exhibit titled “Total  Assets and Selected 
Balance Sheet Items”).  The liab ility side of the balance sheet  is projected to be 
composed of $2.4 trillion—or 11 percent of nominal GDP—of nonre serve liabilities, and 
just under $1.3 trillion—or about 6 percent of nominal GDP—of r eserve balances.2  By 
assumption, once reserves reach $1 trillion, in the fourth quarter of 2021, the size of the 
balance sheet as a share of no minal GDP is projected to remain constant at nearly 
16 percent.3  For comparison, the size of the  balance sheet as a share of G DP peaked at 
about 25 percent in the fourt h quarter of 2014 and averaged about 5 percent over the 
decade prior to the crisis.  Aft er reserves reach $1 trillion, SOMA holdings are projected 
to start rising in line with nominal GDP, keeping pace with inc reases in Federal Reserve 
liabilities and Federal Reserve Bank capital.4  
Because of the faster projected p ace of MBS prepayments, the sh are of agency 
MBS in the SOMA portfolio, which  currently stands at 42 percent, is expected to decline 
a bit more rapidly than in the April Tealbook, falling to about  18 percent of the SOMA 
portfolio by the end of 2025, compared to 19 percent in April.  
                                                 
2 Reserve projections included in Tealbook B do not incorporate effects related to the debt limit 
episode as TGA balances are assume d to grow in line with nomina l GDP over the projection period.  When 
Treasury’s debt limit practices a re factored into the TGA proje ctions, end-September reserve balances are 
projected to be around $1.6 trillion, about $300 billion higher  than the level of reserves projected in the 
Tealbook baseline.  Following the resolution of the debt limit impasse, the level of reserve balances will 
likely decline to the l evel projected in the baseline as the Tr easury rebuilds its TGA balance. 
3 Our projections are based on th e assumption that reserve balan ces will continue to decline until 
they reach $1 trillion, the same assumption as in the April Tea lbook.  However, as discussed in the March 
FOMC memo “Transitioning to an Ample Reserves Regime with Lower  Reserves,” the actual level at 
which the decline in reserves will cease is uncer tain and will need to be determined in light of information 
regarding banks’ reserve demand. 
4 In this Tealbook, we adjusted  our technical assumptions with respect to the growth of a few 
liability items.  In particular, we now assume that liabilities other than currency and reserves, such as the 
foreign repo pool and DFMU balances, grow in line with nominal GDP from the start of the projection 
period, rather than after the  decline in reserves ceases.

 SOMA portfolio characteristics.  The weighted-average  duration of the SOMA 
Treasury portfolio is currently j ust above six and a half years (see the top panel of the 
exhibit titled “Projec tions for the Characteristics of SOMA Treasury Securities 
Holdings”).  Duration is proje cted to edge up to nearly seven y ears as redemptions 
continue through September and lo nger-duration securities becom e a larger share of the 
portfolio.5  Thereafter, duration stays roughl y constant unti l the decline in reserve 
balances ends and the SOMA portfolio begins to expand again in the 
fourth quarter of 2021. 
In this Tealbook, we have brought ou r assumptions regarding reinvestment of 
principal payments from maturi ng Treasury securities once the d ecline in reserve 
balances ends in line with the  Desk’s longstanding reinvestment practices.  We now 
assume that rollovers of maturing Treasury securities will be d irected to newly-issued 
securities at Treasur y auctions in proporti on to the maturity d istribution of the issuance 
amounts for the rest of  the projection horizon.6  Meanwhile, for secondary market 
purchases of Treasury securities aimed at reinvesting principal payments from agency 
securities holdings and at accommodating growth in Federal Rese rve liabilities, we have 
retained the assumptions of the  previous Tealbook that those pu rchases will be directed 
toward Treasury bills until bills comprise approximately one-th ird of the Treasury 
portfolio, similar to the pre-crisis composition.7   
The process of rebuilding the  Treasury bill portion of the port folio is expected to 
take about 5½ years, t hus leading to a gra dual reduction in the  weighted-average duration 
of the Treasury portfolio to just under 5 years.  Thereafter, f urther secondary-market 
purchases of Treasury securities are assumed to be spread across the maturity spectrum 
                                                 
5 These projections assume that rollovers of maturing Treasury s ecurities will be allocated across 
newly issued securities at Treasur y auctions on a pro-rata basi s in proportion with the amounts being 
issued.  Consistent with the Des k’s interim plan for reinvestin g principal payments f rom agency debt and 
MBS into Treasury securities beginning in October 2019, these p urchases will be spread across the 
Treasury curve in line with the amounts outstanding in each sec tor.  Secondary-ma rket purchases of 
Treasury securities will be distr ibuted across eight sectors fo r nominal coupon securities and one sector 
each for bills, Treasury Inflation-Protect ed Securities (TIPS),  and Floating Rate Notes (FRNs).  Of note, the 
share of these purchases alloca ted to bills will be 15 percent, while the share allocated to coupon securities 
with residual maturity shorter t han three years will be 41 percent. 
6 In previous Tealbooks, we had assumed that, once the decline i n reserves ceases, principal 
payments from maturing Treasury securities would be entirely re invested in Treasury b ills until the share of 
Treasury bills in the Treasury  securities port folio reaches abo ut one-third. 
7 Given that the Committee has not yet reached a decision on the  long-run composition of the 
SOMA portfolio, we retain this purchase assumption in the curre nt projections.

 (see the bottom panel of the exhi bit).  Relative to the April T ealbook, the revised 
technical assumptions relative to rollovers of Treasury securities not only result in a more 
gradual decline in the weighted -average duration of the portfol io over the next several 
years but also result in a lower  weighted-average duration in t he longer run.8   
Federal Reserve remittances.  Remittances to the Treasury are projected to 
decline to $49 billion this  year from $65 billion in 2018 (see the exhibit “Income 
Projections”), mainly reflecting r educed interest income resulting from the reduction in 
SOMA securities holdings.9  Total interest expense is  projected to be $42 billion this 
year, little changed from 2018.10,11  Remittances are expected t o increase to $53 billion 
next year, and continue to rise, reflecting an increase in net interest income associated 
with a growing balance sheet.  Rel ative to the previous Tealboo k, the projected path for 
remittances is generally a bit lower, reflecting the lower MBS coupon income resulting 
from the faster projected pace of MBS prepayments. As shown in the middle right panel 
of the exhibit “Income Projecti ons,” annual remittances are projected to rise gradually 
from around 0.25 percent of nominal GDP next year to just below  0.3 percent by the end 
of the projection horizon. 
Unrealized gains or losses.  The SOMA portfolio was i n a net unrealized gain 
position of about $110 billion at the end of May.12  With longer-term interest rates 
projected to rise, the unrealized gain position is expected to turn into an unrealized loss 
                                                 
8 The lower weighted-average duration of the SOMA in the longer run reflects a lower weighted-
average duration in the assumed distribution of Treasury issuan ce relative to that of the maturity spectrum 
into which principal payments of  maturing Treasury securities w ere assumed to be reinvested in previous 
Tealbooks.  
9 Remittances in 2018 included two mandated transfers to the Tre asury due to reductions to the 
statutory limit on aggregate Reserve Bank surplus.  First, $2.5  billion was transferred in February 2018 
following an amendment to Section 7 of the Federal Reserve Act by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, 
enacted in that month.  Second, $675 million was transferred in  June 2018, reflecting another amendment 
to Section 7 by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Con sumer Protection Act, enacted in 
May 2018. 
10 The effects of the increase in t he IOER and the decrease in re serves since 2018 on total interest 
expense approximately offset each other. 
11 We continue to assume that the FOMC will set a 25  basis point-wide target range for the federal 
funds rate throughout the projection period.  Consistent with t he FOMC’s May 2019 Implementation Note, 
we now assume that the interest rates paid on reserve balances will be set 15 basis points below the top of 
the target range.  We continue to assume that the offering rate  on overnight RRPs will be set at the bottom 
of the range. 
12 See the Tealbook B box titled “W hat Does it Mean for the SOMA Portfolio to be in an 
‘Unrealized Loss’ Position?” (Jun e 2018) for an explanation of the accounting concepts underlying  
unrealized and realized gain an d loss positions, as well as the ir implications for the Federal Reserve’s 
ability to meet its obligations.

 position by late 2020 and reach a peak around $80 billion in 2025:Q1.  Compared with 
the April Tealbook, the path for the unrealized position of the  SOMA portfolio is higher 
over the next several years reflecting the lower path for longer-term interest rates. 
Total term premium effect .  SOMA securities holdings are estimated to be 
reducing the term premium embe dded in the 10-year Treasury yiel d by about 130 basis 
points in the current quarter (s ee the exhibit “P rojections for  the 10-year Treasury Total 
Term Premium Effect”).  Over the projection horizon, the magnit ude of the downward 
pressure exerted on the term premium in Treasury yields is estimated to diminish gradually as a result of the proj ected decrease in the duration  of the Federal Reserve’s 
securities holdings as well as  the projected continued decrease  in the size of the SOMA 
portfolio relative to nominal  GDP through of the fourth quarter  of 2021.  Over the next 
decade, the average pace of decline is projected to be about 4 basis points per year so that 
the total term premium effect of  the SOMA portfolio for the 10- year Treasury yield is 
less than 100 basis point s at the end of 2030. 
Relative to the April projecti on, the contour of the total term  premium effect 
(TTPE) is a few basis point s more negative through 2022, but it is slightly l ess negative 
over the longer term reflecting the revised technical assumptio ns regarding rollovers of 
Treasury securities.

13 The small downward revision to the TTPE path over the next few  years is due to a more gradual 
projected decline in t he weighted-average duration of the Treas ury portfolio than in the previous Tealbook, 
while in the longer run, the slightly less negative TTPE reflec ts the lower projected l evel of the weighted-
average duration.
