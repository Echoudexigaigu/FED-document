Monetary Policy Alternatives 
The alternative policy statemen ts presented below offer a range  of options for the 
stance and likely near-term pat h of monetary poli cy.  Alternati ve B points to the 
implications of global developmen ts for the economic outlook, a long with muted 
inflation pressures, as reasons f or easing the stance of moneta ry policy at this meeting.  
Under Alternative B, the Comm ittee would lower the target range  for the federal funds 
rate by ¼ percentage point, and woul d note that this action sup ports the Committee’s 
view that sustained expansion of  economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and 
inflation near the Committee’ s symmetric 2 percent objective re main the most likely 
outcomes.  The Committee would con tinue to signal its intention  to act as appropriate to 
sustain these outcomes.  Finally, the Committee would announce its decision to conclude 
the reduction of the Federal Reserve’s aggregate securities hol dings in August.  
Alternative A gives a similar assessment of the incoming data to that in 
Alternative B, but acknowledges that indicators of longer-term inflation expectations 
remain low.  It describes the vi ew that inflation running persi stently below 2 percent, in 
addition to the implications of gl obal developments for the eco nomic outlook, call for a 
larger policy response in Jul y.  Specifically, under this alternative, policymakers would 
lower the target range for the  federal funds rate by ½ percenta ge point and provide a 
strong signal that additional easing is likely.  With this easi ng, alongside a statement of 
the Committee’s preparedness to make further adjustments to the  target range for the 
federal funds rate, policymakers would maintain the positive economic outlook that the 
Committee articulated in June.  Unde r Alternative A, the Committee would also 
announce the conclusion of the reduction of the Federal Reserve ’s securities holdings. 
Alternative C mainta ins the current polic y stance and repeats t he policy message 
associated with the June FOMC meeting.  In particular, it continues to indicate that the 
Committee views sustained expansion of economic activity, stron g labor market 
conditions, and inflation near the  Committee’s symmetric 2 perc ent objective as the most 
likely outcomes with the current  policy stance, while acknowledging that uncertainties 
about this outlook remain elevated.

 With regard to the specifics of the language in Alternatives A,  B, and C: 
 The assessment of the incoming data: 
o Alternatives B and C share the same characterization of the inc oming data.  
Both alternatives continue to portr ay the labor market as stron g, while noting 
that the unemployment rate remai ns low and that average job gains in recent 
months have been solid.  Alt hough both alternatives describe ec onomic 
growth as “moderate” or “solid,” (pending Friday’s GDP release)  they 
acknowledge recent divergent developments in household and busi ness 
spending by observing that “although growth of household spendi ng has 
picked up from earlier in the ye ar, growth of business fixed in vestment has 
been soft.”  Both alternatives note that “overall inflation and  inflation for 
items other than food and ener gy are running below 2 percent,” and that 
“market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low,” w hile 
“survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little 
changed.” 
o Alternative A differs in its de scription of incoming informatio n from 
Alternatives B and C by giving a m ore general ch aracterization of indicators 
of inflation expectations.  Under Alternative A, the Committee would point 
out that, “On balance, indicators of longer-run inflation expec tations remain 
low.” 
 The outlook for economic activity and inflation: 
o Under all three alternatives, the modal outlook for economic ac tivity and 
inflation is unchanged from that conveyed in the June FOMC statement.  However, to support the outcomes of “sustained expansion of eco nomic 
activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near th e Committee’s 
symmetric 2 percent objective,” the alternatives convey differe nt paths for the 
federal funds rate.  Alternative C also notes that the uncertai nties about this 
outlook remain elevated.  
 For the current policy decision and the outlook for policy: 
o Alternative B lowers t he target range for the federal funds rate by 
¼ percentage point, while Alternativ e A lowers the target range  by 
½ percentage point.  Alternatives  A and B also announce the Com mittee’s 
decision to “conclude the reduc tion of its aggregate securities  holdings in the

 System Open Market Account in August, two months earlier than p reviously 
indicated.”  
o Regarding the outlook for policy, Alternatives B and C continue  to state that 
the Committee “will act as appropr iate to sustain the expansion , with a strong 
labor market and inflation near  its symmetric  2 percent objecti ve.” In contrast, 
Alternative A states that the Committee is “prepared to make fu rther 
adjustments in the target range for the federal funds rate” to achieve its 
objectives.

 JUNE 2019  FOMC  STATEMENT  
1. Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in May 
indicates that the labor marke t remains strong and that economi c activity is rising 
at a moderate rate.  Job gains ha ve been solid, on average, in recent months, and 
the unemployment rate has remained low.  Although growth of household 
spending appears to have picke d up from earlier in the year, in dicators of business 
fixed investment have been soft.  On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and 
inflation for items other th an food and energy are running belo w 2 percent.  
Market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined; survey-based 
measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little chang ed. 
 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum 
employment and price stability.  I n support of the se goals, the Committee decided 
to maintain the target range fo r the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent.  
The Committee continues to view  sustained expansion of economic activity, 
strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committe e’s symmetric 2 
percent objective as the most likely outcomes, but uncertaintie s about this outlook 
have increased.  In light of thes e uncertainties and muted inflation pressures, the 
Committee will closely monitor the implications of incoming inf ormation for the 
economic outlook and will act as a ppropriate to sustain the exp ansion, with a 
strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective. 
 
3. In determining the timing and size  of future adjustments to the  target range for the 
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expe cted economic 
conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its  symmetric 2 
percent inflation objective.  Thi s assessment will take into account a wide range 
of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of 
inflation pressures and inflati on expectations, and readings on  financial and 
international developments.

expectations remain low.  
 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum 
employment and price stabilit y.  In support of these goals light of the 
implications of global developme nts for the economic outlook as well as 
inflation running persistently below 2 percent , the Committee decided to 
maintain lower  the target range for the federal funds rate at to 1-3/4 to 2  2-1/4 to 
2-1/2 percent.  This action supports  the Committee ’s continues to view that  
sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market c onditions, and 
inflation near the Committee’ s symmetric 2 percent objective as remain  the most 
likely outcomes, but uncertainties  about this outlook have incr eased.  In light of 
these uncertainties and muted inflation pressures, The Committe e will closely 
monitor the implications of incom ing information for the econom ic outlook and 
will act as appropriate is prepared to make further  adjustments in the target 
range for the federal funds rate  to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor 
market and inflation near its s ymmetric 2 percent objective. 
 3. In determining the timing and size  of future adjustments to the  target range for the 
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expe cted economic 
conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its  symmetric 2

of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of 
inflation pressures and inflati on expectations, and readings on  financial and 
international developments. 
 
4. The Committee will conclude the reduction of its aggregate secu rities 
holdings in the System Open Market Account in August, two month s earlier 
than previously indicated.  The C ommittee decided to maintain i ts securities 
holdings while it is providing accommodation through lowering t he target 
range for the federal funds rate.

 ECONOMIC  CONDITIONS  AND  OUTLOOK 
 The staff estimates that real  GDP growth slowed from about 3 percent in the first 
quarter to 2½ percent in the second, despite a strong rebound i n consumer spending.  
Growth of business investment  has slowed notably, and forward-l ooking indicators of 
investment remain downbeat.  The s taff projects that real GDP g rowth will slow 
further to a 1¾ percent pace in the second half of the year as government spending 
growth steps down from its tempor arily-high second-quarter rate and business 
investment remains sluggis h amid ongoing concerns about trade t ensions and global 
growth.  Economic growth is proj ected to slow over the next sev eral years, largely 
reflecting the waning effects of  fiscal policy impetus.  In add ition, the staff anticipates 
that concerns about trade policy and global growth will continu e to weigh on 
aggregate demand.  
 Available data indicate that the  labor market continued to tigh ten so far this year but 
at a more gradual pace than in 2018. 
o Payrolls rose 224,000 in June, and gains averaged 171,000 per m onth over the 
past three months, well above the pace that the staff estimates to be consistent with no change in resource utilization.  With GDP projected to decelerate over 
the medium term, the staff expects payroll gains to slow.  
o The unemployment rate ticke d up 0.1 percentage point to 3.7 percent in June, 
and staff projects that it will remain at this level through th e end of 2019.   
The labor force participati on rate edged up to 62.9 percent in June.  
o Average hourly earnings rose 3.1 percent over the 12 months ending in June, and are projected to continue to grow at a similar pace over th e coming 
months.  This rate of growth is  higher than in previous years, but it has 
softened somewhat in recent months, even in the face of strong labor 
utilization.   
 Despite the unemployment rate  having run at or below 4 percent for well over a year, 
there are few signs of upward pressure on inflation.  Headline inflation has continued 
to run below the Committee’s sy mmetric 2 percent objective; cor e PCE inflation has 
also been below 2 percent.  Infla tion is expected to move up la ter this year, as the 
effects of idiosyncratic and t emporary factors that have held down inflation dissipate. 
o The staff estimates that the 12- month change in core PCE prices  increased 
from 1.5 percent in March to 1.7 perc ent in June.  The staff projects this 
measure of inflation to rise to 1.9 percent in August and remai n at this level

 over the forecast horizon.  Total  PCE price inflation is estima ted at 1.5 percent 
in June and is forecast to move up through the second half of t he year to 1.8 
percent in December, reflecting both the anticipated increase i n core inflation 
and an expected acceleration in food prices over the second half of the year.  
With energy prices expected to edge down over the forecast peri od, total PCE 
price inflation is projected to r un just a little below the core rate.  
o Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are  little changed 
since the June FOMC meeting and generally remain near the lower  end of 
their historical ranges.  Market-based measures of inflation co mpensation 
moved up but remain below their le vels earlier this year.   
 Investor sentiment towards ris ky assets improved in recent mont hs, largely reflecting 
expectations of more- accommodative monetary policy.  Equity pri ces increased and 
credit spreads narrowed modestly.  On net, Treasury yields were little changed over 
the intermeeting period but remai n well below levels seen prior to May.   
 Although the staff expects forei gn economic growth to edge up o ver the second half 
of the year from its very subdue d pace earlier this year, it is not clear that the global 
economy has made it out of its soft patch.  In response, some f oreign central banks 
have eased their policy stance, w hile others have indicated tha t they are poised to do 
so.  
 The staff continues to judge that the risks to i ts outlook for growth are tilted to the 
downside over the next year, as well as further out.  Uncertain ties related to trade 
policies, Brexit nego tiations, and foreign economic developments—along with the 
potential for adverse reactions i n financial markets to these r isks—could be having 
significant negative effects  on U.S. economic activity.

 THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
Although policymakers may have seen that the case for a somewha t more 
accommodative monetary policy had strengthened already at the t ime of the June 
meeting, they decided not to adjus t the policy stance at that time, preferring instead to 
signal their willingness to act a s appropriate while awaiting t he arrival of additional 
information.  Since then, they might have reached the judgment that global 
developments—including concer ns about global growth and ongoing  uncertainties 
around trade policies—are conti nuing to weigh on the U.S. economic outlook.  At the 
same time, with inflation pressures still muted, and in light o f continued low readings on 
indicators of longer-term inflati on expectations, policymakers may be concerned about 
inflation failing to return to t he Committee’s symmetric 2 perc ent objective on a 
sustained basis.  They may also judge that, in the face of thes e challenges, the economic 
outlook has been supported by a notab le easing in financial con ditions over recent 
months, in response to communicat ions by the Federal Reserve an d other central banks.  
In these circumstances, policymakers may determine that a modes t easing in the stance of 
monetary policy is appropriate.   
Under Alternative B, policymaker s would communicate that, “in l ight of the 
implications of global developmen ts for the economic outlook as  well as muted inflation 
pressures,” the Committee would l ower the target range for the federal funds rate to 2 to 
2-1/4 percent.  Alternat ive B also announces that the reduction in the size of the Federal 
Reserve’s securities holdings will end in August, two months so oner than previously 
indicated.  Although the economic  effects of ending balance she et runoff at the beginning 
of August, as opposed to the end of September, are estimated to be very minor because 
the amount of additional reinvestments is small, policymakers m ay view this step as 
warranted to avoid being percei ved as having their policy tools  work in opposite 
directions and to bypass the associ ated communications challeng es. 
Policymakers may view recent developments and incoming data as evidence that 
concerns about global growth and ongoing trade uncertainty are weighing on the U.S. 
economic outlook.  Although there has been a rebound in consume r spending growth 
from its lackluster pace earlier this year, the growth of busin ess fixed investment has 
slowed to a standstill, while manufacturing production remains weak.  The softness in 
business fixed investment and manufacturing, if it continues, could result in a further 
slowdown in economic growth.  A lthough policymakers may see con tinued strong 
economic conditions and a gradual rise of inflation to 2 percen t as the most likely

 outcomes, they might judge that th ese outcomes are predicated o n a somewhat lower path 
for the policy rate.  
Policymakers may judge that ther e are no discernible upward pre ssures on 
inflation despite the fact that labor market conditions remain strong—including the very 
low unemployment rate, solid nominal wage growth, and the fact that job gains have been 
solid, on average, in recent mont hs.  In the June Summary of Economic Projections, 
while almost all participants project the unemployment rate to remain below their 
estimates of its longer-run lev el, they generally do not expect  high levels of labor 
utilization to be associate d with notable upward pressure on in flation.   
Even though the latest monthly data on consumer prices have bee n firmer than 
readings from earlier in the  year, inflation has been running b elow the Committee’s 
2 percent objective.  Additionally, inflation pressures are mut ed, and indicators of  
longer-term inflation expectations remain l ow.  Policymakers may judge that the 
continued shortfall of infla tion could result in a softening of  inflation expectations and 
could slow the sustained return of inflation to the Committee’s  2 percent objective.  
Therefore, a somewhat more acco mmodative monetary policy stance , along the lines of 
Alternative B, would help to suppor t inflation expectations and  promote a return of 
inflation to the 2 percent objective.   
Policymakers may also view the r isks to the outlook for economi c activity and 
inflation as weighted to the downside.  In particular, they may  be concerned that trade 
policies, Brexit nego tiations, and foreign economic developments—along with financial 
market reactions to these ongoing developments—could move in di rections that would 
have significant negative effects on U.S. economic activity rat her than toward a favorable 
resolution.  In that case, polic ymakers may judge that the risk s to the outlook warrant the 
provision of additional accommoda tion in the near term on risk-management grounds.  
They might also judge that, should these risks abate and econom ic activity and inflation 
turn out to be stronger than exp ected, the Committee would have  ample tools at its 
disposal to manage the situa tion.  In the opposite scenario, under which the headwinds 
and risks intensify, the costs t o the economy and the credibility of the Committee’s 
commitment to 2 percent inflation would likely be more signific ant, especially in light of 
the proximity of the policy rat e to its effective lower bound.       
While investor sentiment toward risky assets improved in recent  months, this 
improvement importantly reflecte d notable shifts in expectation s regarding monetary

 policy.  Consistent with such expectations, market prices, alon g with responses to the 
Desk’s latest surveys of primary dealers and market participants, currently indicate that a 
reduction in the target range by 25 basis points at the July me eting is widely expected, 
and at least one additional 25 basi s point reduction later in t he year is viewed as very 
likely.  The surveys also show tha t many market participants ex pect the Committee to 
announce a conclusion of the reduction of the Federal Reserve’s  securities holdings at the 
July FOMC meeting, although a similar number of respondents exp ect a continuation of 
balance sheet runoff until Septe mber.  On balance, a statement along the lines of 
Alternative B appears broadly consistent with mar ket participan ts’ expectations for the 
outcome of this meeting.

   Monetary  Policy Expectations  and Uncertainty  
Expectations  for the path  of the federal funds  rate exhibited  notable shifts  over the  
intermeeting  period in response  to Federal  Reserve communications  and economic  
data releases, and  they ended the period slightly lower, on  net.  Towards the  end of 
the period, financial market prices suggested  a high likelihood  of a 25 basis point 
reduction in  the target range  for the federal funds  rate at the  July FOMC meeting.   
Respondents  to the Desk’s July surveys similarly attached  high odds to a 25 basis  point 
rate cut at  the upcoming  meeting.  
Figure 1 shows the market‐implied probability  distribution  of the federal funds  rate 
following  the July 2019 meeting,  as derived from  a straight read  of the most recent 
quotes on options and not adjusted for risk premiums.   After notable shifts, it ended 
the period with about  70 percent odds on  a 25 basis  point decline in the target range  
at the July  meeting.  However,  some probability  was also attached  to a 50 basis  point 
reduction or  no change in the target range.   The corr esponding  average probability  
distribution  from the July Desk surveys (figure 2) showed  very similar odds.  Survey 
respondents  assigned  on average around 20 percent probability  to a 50 basis  point 
reduction  in the target range,  70 percent probability  to a 25 basis  point reduction,  and 
a 10 percent  probability  to no change in the target range.  
The option ‐implied probability  distribution  of the federal funds  rate following  the 
September  FOMC meeting shifted slightly toward lower values  (not shown).  The 
distribution  continues  to imply that the federal funds  rate is most likely to fall in the 
1.75 to 2 percent range, and it now assigns slightly higher odds to that  outcome  than 
at the time  of the June FOMC meeting.1  The option‐implied distribution  for the  end of 
2019 (figure 3) also shifted slightly lower and currently  suggests  that the federal funds  
rate is most likely to end the year in  either the 1.5 to 1.75  percent range, or the 1.75 to 2 
percent range.  In contrast, the  corresponding  year‐ end probability  distribution  from 
the July Desk surveys (figure 4)  is centered  around the 1.75 to 2 percent range, with 
respondents  placing, on  average,  about 40 percent probability  to that outcome,  while 
assigning  about 20  and 25 percent probability  to the 1.5 to 1.75  and 2 to 2.25 percent 
ranges, respectively.   The differences  between the market‐implied  and survey‐implied 
distribution  likely reflect negative  risk prem iums and liquidity premiums  embedded  in 
the option quotes. 
Figure 5 compares  various measures  of the expected  federal funds  rate path over  the 
next few years.   On net over the  intermeeting  period, financial market measures  of 
the expected  federal funds  rate over th e next few years  declined  modestly.   A straight  
read of forward rates  derived from  overnight index  swaps (the blue line) suggests  
that investors  currently  expect the federal funds rate to decline 69 basis points by

end‐2019 and a further 35 basis  points by end‐2020.  For  comparison,  the latest path  
from a staff term structure  model that  adjusts for term premiums (the  purple line), 
suggests that investors  expect declines of 43 basis points by end‐2019 and little 
change in 2020.  An alternative  macro‐ finance model of  the expected  federal  funds 
rate path (in  green) lies closer to the unadjusted  forward rate path,  suggesting  a 
decline of about 60 basis points by end‐2019 and an additional  25 basis points by end‐
2020.  The modal path  for the federal funds rate reported  by the median  respondent 
to the Desk’s July surveys (the brown diamonds)  continued  to
 point to a 50 basis  
point decline in the target range  by year‐ end 2019, and  then a flat path thereafter.2     
Figure 6 shows the median and  interquartile  range of  respondents’  modal federal 
funds rate projections  from the Desk’s July surveys (in blue) relative to the June 
surveys (in green).   Whereas  the median projections  (the orange bars) were 
unchanged  from the June surveys, the interquartile  range for end‐2019 collapsed  to 
the median projection  and narrowed  for end‐2020.  While  these changes  appear to 
reflect considerably  more agreement  among survey respondents  about the most 
likely path of monetary  policy over the  next two 
years, one should be cautious  about 
interpreting  these changes as a reduction  in the uncertainty  market participants  
associate with  their projec tions.  Figure  7 shows  market‐based measures  of monetary  
policy uncertainty  at horizons  of 6 and 18 months ahead derived from  option prices.  
Although  these measures  declined  somewhat  over the  intermeeting  period, they 
remain at the top of their range in recent years, suggesting  ongoing uncertainty  
among market participants  about the path of monetar y policy over  the next few 
years.3 
Figure 8 shows measures  of the longer‐run expected  federal funds  rate.  A straight  
read of forward rates  implied by Treasury  yields suggests  that investors’  current 
expectation for  the average federal funds  rate 5 to 10 years  ahead (the blue line) was 
little changed  over the  intermeeting  period, and stands at about 2.3 percent.  
Adjusting  for term premiums using  various staff term 
structure  models (with the  light‐
red‐shaded region showing  a range of  three such model estimates)  continues  to 
suggest that 5‐to‐ 10‐year‐ ahead expectations  are above the unadjusted  forward rates, 
at between 2.9  and 3.1 percent,  consistent  with a neg ative term premium   at those 
horizons.   In contrast,  the median longer ‐run forecast  from the Desk’s July surveys 
(the green diamonds)  are closer to the unadjusted  forward rates.  Although  the July 
reading was unchanged  from the June surveys, these forecasts  lie notably below their 
levels of the past few years.  
2 The most likely timing  of declines in the target range during the remainder  of this year are the 
July and September  meetings,  each with a 25 basis point reduction.   This represents  a shift from  the 
June Desk surveys when the modal expectation  was for declines at the September  and December  
meetings.  
3 Similar‐horizon measures  of interest  rate volatility  derived from swaptions  also  remained

 THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C  
If policymakers do not yet see significant evidence that global  developments are 
weighing on the economic outlook, or view incoming data as sugg esting a better-than-
expected outlook for the economy and inflation, they may prefer  to wait for more 
information before adjusting the stance of policy.  In that cas e, the Committee may 
maintain the current target rang e while continuing to signal th at, in light of uncertainties 
about the outlook and muted inflation pressures, the committee will “closely monitor the 
implications of incoming inform ation for the economic outlook and will act as 
appropriate to sustain the expansion.”  
Policymakers may have anticipat ed a moderation in overall outpu t growth in the 
second quarter, and view it as ref lecting primarily the reversa l of substantial boosts to 
first-quarter growth from net exports and inventory investment.   They may see the 
apparent softness in business sp ending as transitory and, with household spending 
picking up markedly from earlier in the year, they may anticipa te that spending growth 
will be near potential over t he remainder of 2019.  They may al so view recent economic 
indicators, including quite upbeat  readings on consumer sentime nt, strong labor market 
conditions, and the rebound in payrol l gains in June from a wea k reading in May as 
consistent with a solid economic outlook.   
 Policymakers may interpret the  softness in inflation as being caused largely or 
entirely by transitory factors a nd therefore be confident that,  under the current monetary 
policy stance, inflation will ri se to the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium 
term.  Policymakers may also be concerned that price pressures from high levels of 
resource utilization could event ually lead to gre ater upward pr essure on wages and prices, 
consistent with the predictions of models that imply nonlinear responses of inflation to 
resource utilization.  In addition, they may judge long-term in flation expectations to be 
sufficiently well-anchored at le vels consistent with the Committee’s 2 percent objective.  
They may therefore deem the current stance of policy as appropr iate. 
In addition, policymakers may view current financial conditions  as highly 
accommodative, and may be concerned about vulnerabilities arisi ng to financial stability 
from lower interest rates.  For example, they may see that pric es in equity and bond 
markets are near historic peaks , while valuation pressures in l everaged loan and 
commercial real estate market s remain high.  Putting all these considerations together, 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
July 25, 2019
Page 17 of 40

 they might judge that financial stability considerations strengthen the case for leaving 
rates unchanged.  
Alternative C would be inconsiste nt with the widely-held expect ation of a 
reduction in the target range for  the federal funds rate at the  upcoming meeting, and so it 
might result in a significant r epricing in financial markets.  Market expectations for the 
path of short-term interest ra tes would likely move up, while e quity prices and inflation 
compensation would likely fall .  Although policymakers may view some correction in 
market expectations as warrant ed, the apparent inconsistency of  Alternative C with recent 
Federal Reserve communications could cause confusion among investors about the 
Committee’s intentions. 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
If policymakers view risks to t he outlook for the economy as significantly 
weighted to the downside or are  increasingly worried about the ongoing weakness in 
inflation and inflation expecta tions, they may deem it appropriate to provide a substantial 
amount of monetary policy accommodation to sustain the economic  expansion and 
support the return of inflation and inflation expectations to levels consistent with the 
Committee’s symmetric 2 percent ob jective.  Moreover, they may judge that a larger cut 
in the target range for the federal funds rate could help cushion the effects of possible adverse shocks to the econom y and, hence, would be appropriate policy from a risk-
management perspective.  With A lternative A, policymakers would communicate that, in 
light of “the implica tions of global developments for the econo mic outlook as well as 
inflation running persistently below 2 percent,” the Committee “decided to lower the 
target range for the federal funds rate to 1-3/4 to 2 percent.”  Alternative A would also 
signal the Committee’s preparedness to make further adjustments to the target range for 
the federal funds rate to susta in the expansion, and it would a lso announce the end of 
balance sheet re duction in August.  
With inflation running persistently below the Committee’s symme tric 2 percent 
objective, and longer-run measures  of inflation expectations near the lower end of their 
historical ranges, policymakers may be concerned that inflation  expectations have already 
moved below levels consistent with the Committee’s 2 percent ob jective.  That being the 
case, they may see significant risks that inflation could fail to return to 2 percent on a 
sustained basis, partic ularly if resource utilization were to s often.  They might also judge 
that, should inflation move above 2 percent for a time, a modes t overshooting of the 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
July 25, 2019
Page 18 of 40
Authorized for Public Release
  
  
 target would be consistent wit h the Committee’s longer-term goa ls and would help re-
center inflation and inflation expectations on the 2-percent ob jective.  In this case, they 
might deem it appropriate to lower  the target range for the fed eral funds rate by ½ 
percentage point and s ignal that additional monetary policy acc ommodation may be 
forthcoming in the near future.  Accordingly, und er Alternative A, the Committee would 
stress that it “is prepared to mak e further adjustments in the target range for the federal 
funds rate” to support its objectives. 
Policymakers may judge that, in the absence of an offsetting po licy response, 
global developments will wei gh heavily on the economic outlook.   They may also judge 
that, in light of the proximit y of the policy rate to its effec tive lower bound, policymakers 
should act forcefully when confr onted with risks to the outlook .  They may view the 
slowing in business fixed invest ment and manufacturing producti on so far this year as 
pointing to a more substantial  downshift in economic growth tha n that in the staff’s 
baseline.  They might also regard staff projections suggesting that economic growth in 
the second half of the year will slow notably as consistent wit h the notion that global 
developments are significantl y weighing on the economic outlook.  They may view 
recent apparent progress on trade negotiations as likely to be followed by a renewed 
extended period of uncertainty that will have adverse implicati ons for aggregate demand.  
Policymakers may also be concerne d about the persistently flat slope of the Treasury 
yield curve and view it as consis tent with a significant probab ility of a recession over the 
next year, unless significant monetary accommodation is provide d.  
A statement such as Alternativ e A would likely be seen by marke t participants as 
implying a more accommodative path for the policy rate than had  been anticipated, and 
market expectations for the fed eral funds rate would likely fal l.  If, in addition, market 
participants judged Alternative A as indicating a more accommod ative policy reaction 
function, then equity prices and i nflation compensation would likely rise.  The effect on 
the dollar might be more ambiguous , with lower real rates and higher future inflation 
pointing to depreciation, but s tronger economic activity sugges ting the opposite.  In 
contrast, if market participants  inferred from Alternative A that the outlook for economic 
activity and inflation was bleak er than they had been expecting , equity prices would 
likely fall together with the e xchange value of the dollar, and  possibly inflation 
compensation.

Balance Sheet and Income Projections 
The staff has prepared projecti ons of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the 
associated income statement under two scenarios, which are both  consistent with staff 
projections in Tealbook A.  The s cenarios differ only with regard to the policy 
assumptions concerning the timing for the end of balance sheet runoff.  As in the June 
Tealbook, in the baseline scenari o the staff assumes that the r eduction in tot al securities 
holdings concludes at the end of S eptember, consistent with the  Balance Sheet 
Normalization Principles and Plans that the Committee released after the March 2019 
FOMC meeting.  In the alternative sc enario—labeled “Earlier End  to Runoff”—it is 
assumed that the reduction in tot al securities hol dings concludes by August 1, consistent 
with Alternatives A a nd B shown in the Moneta ry Policy Alternat ives section of 
Tealbook B.  
Relative to the June Tealbook, the  paths for longer-term intere st rates in the staff’s 
financial projections have bee n revised down somewhat.  Through the end of 2021, the 
10-year Treasury yield is, on ave rage, about 15 basis points lower, while the path for the
30-year fixed mortgage rate was revised down a bit less.  These  revisions affect the
balance sheet projections in both scenarios, as they imply higher agency MBS
prepayment activity than projec ted in June.  At this stage in t he normalization process,
higher prepayment activity has im plications mostly for the comp osition, rather than the
size, of the balance sheet.
Evolution of the SOMA portfolio.  Under the baseline scenario, cumulative 
redemptions since October 2017 are projected to reach $753 billion by the time the reduction in the size of SOMA hol dings concludes at the end of the third quarter.  Of this 
total, redemptions of Treasury and agency securities will amoun t to $419 billion and 
$334 billion, respectively (see th e table in the exhibit “Redem ptions and Reinvestments 
of SOMA Principal Payments - Baseline ”).  Over the same period, cumulative 
reinvestments of principal paym ents received from holdings of T reasury and agency 
securities are projected to be $363 billion and $160 billion, respectively.  The lower projected path for the mortgage rate and the resulting faster p ace of MBS prepayments 
imply that, during the third quart er of this year, reinvestments of agency securities are 
$1.3 billion higher than in the  June Tealbook projection.  The corresponding projections 
in the event that the Committee  decides to conclude balance she et runoff earlier are

 shown in the exhibit “Redemptions  and Reinvestments of SOMA Principal Payments – 
Earlier End to Runoff. ”  
In the baseline scenario, by the t ime the reduction in total se curities holdings 
concludes at the end of September, the size of the SOMA portfolio is projected to be 
about $3.5 trillion, consisting of  about $2 trillion of Treasur y securities and $1.5 trillion 
of agency securities (see the e xhibit titled “Total Assets and Selected Balance Sheet 
Items”).  At that time, the bala nce sheet is projected to stand at about 17 percent of 
nominal GDP.  The liability side  of the balance sheet is projected to be composed of 
$2.4 trillion—or 11 percent of nomin al GDP—of nonreserve liabil ities, and 
$1.3 trillion—or about 6  percent of nominal GDP—of reserve bala nces.1,2  We continue 
to assume that, once reserves reach $1 trillion, they will begi n growing in line with 
nominal GDP.3  In the baseline scenario, this point is projec ted to be reach ed in the fourth 
quarter of 2021; thereafter, the size of the balance sheet as a  share of nominal GDP is 
projected to remain cons tant at nearly 16 percent.4  For comparison, the size of the 
balance sheet as a share of GD P averaged about 5 percent over t he decade prior to the 
crisis and peaked at about 25 perc ent in the fourth quarter of 2014.   
Under the “Earlier End to Runoff”  scenario, as depicted by the red lines in the top 
four panels of the exhibit title d “Total Assets and Selected Ba lance Sheet Items,” the 
SOMA portfolio is projected t o be about $35 billion larger than in the baseline scenario 
by the end of August and about $66 billion larger by the end of  September.  Reserve 
balances are projected to fall to $1 trillion during the second  quarter of 2022, two quarters 
later than projected in the baseline scenario, as the larger se curities holdings imply a 
higher trajectory for reserves.  
The share of agency MBS in the S OMA portfolio, which currently stands at 
42 percent, is expected to decline to about 18 percent of the S OMA portfolio by  
                                                 
1 Reserve projections included in  Tealbook B largely leave out e ffects related to the debt limit 
episode as TGA balances are assume d to grow in line with nomina l GDP over the projection period. 
2 Liabilities plus Federal Reserve  Bank capital equals total ass ets, which include the SOMA 
securities portfolio and also ite ms such as unamortized premium s and discounts, and other assets. 
3 As in the June Tealbook, we continue to assume that liabilitie s other than currency and reserves, 
such as the foreign repo pool and DFMU balances, grow in line w ith nominal GDP from the start of the 
projection period.  
4 As discussed in the March FOMC memo “Transitioning to an Ample  Reserves Regime with 
Lower Reserves,” the actual level of reserves prevailing when t he decline in reserves ceases is uncertain 
and will need to be determined in  light of information regardin g banks’ reserve demand.

 the end of 2025 under both scenarios, unchanged from the June p rojection (see the 
exhibit titled “Federal Reserv e Balance Sheet Month-end Project ions – July Tealbook”).  
SOMA portfolio characteristics.   Portfolio characteristi cs are roughly the same 
across the baseline and the “Earlier End to Runoff” scenarios u ntil the end of 2021, when 
securities holdings start growi ng again in the baseline scenario. 
The weighted-average duration of  the SOMA Treasury portfolio is  currently just 
above six and a half years (see the top panel of the exhibit ti tled “Projections for the 
Characteristics of SOMA Treasury S ecurities Holdings”).  In the  baseline scenario, 
duration is projected to edge up to nearly seven years as redem ptions continue through 
September and longer-duration secu rities become a larger share of the portfolio.5  
Thereafter, duration stays roughly constant until the decline i n reserve balances ends and 
the SOMA portfolio begins to expa nd again in the fourth quarter of 2021.  As in the June 
Tealbook, we assume that once the  decline in reserve balances ends, rollovers of 
maturing Treasury securities wil l continue to be directed for t he rest of the projection 
horizon to newly-issued  securities at Treasury auctions in prop ortion to the maturity 
distribution of Treasury debt i ssued at the time of rollover.  For secondary-market 
purchases of Treasury securities aimed at reinvesting principal payments received from 
agency securities holdings and at accommodating growth in Feder al Reserve liabilities, 
we also continue to assume that they will be directed entirely towards Treasury bills until 
bills comprise approximately one-third of the Treasury portfoli o, close to the pre-crisis 
composition.6  The process of rebuilding the  Treasury bill portion of the port folio is 
expected to take about 5 years fr om the time the portfolio star ts expanding again, leading 
to a gradual reduction in the wei ghted-average duration of the Treasury portfolio to just 
under 5 years.  Thereafter, furth er secondary-market purchases of Treasury securities are 
assumed to be spread across the maturity spectrum (see the bott om panel of the exhibit).7 
                                                 
5 In both scenarios, it is assumed that rollovers of maturing Tr easury securities will be allocated 
across newly issued securities at Treasury auctions on a pro-ra ta basis in proportion with the amounts being 
issued.  Consistent with the Des k’s interim plan for reinvestin g principal payments f rom agency debt and 
MBS into Treasury securities once the balance sheet runoff ceases, these purchases will be spread across 
the Treasury maturity spectrum, in line with the amounts outsta nding in each residua l maturity sector. 
6 As the Committee has not yet reac hed a decision on the long-ru n composition of the SOMA 
portfolio, we retain this purchas e assumption in the current pr ojections.   
7 In this Tealbook, we have also implemented an adjustment to ou r technical assumptions 
regarding the maturity distribu tion of secondary-market purchas es of Treasury securities after the 
composition of the  SOMA Treasury portfolio  reaches one-third in  bills.  This purchase distribution now

 Under the “Earlier End to Runoff” s cenario, the weighted-averag e duration 
follows a similar trajectory, but a t a higher level than in the baseline scenario.  Because of 
our assumption that the balance sheet will start growing once r eserve balances have 
reached $1 trillion, duration is projected to remain roughly co nstant for a longer period 
and to start declining later, as th e subsequent purchases directed towards Treasury bills 
begin at a later date.   
Federal Reserve remittances.  In both the baseline and “Earlier End to Runoff” 
scenarios, remittances to the Treasury are projected to decline  to $50 billion this year 
from $65 billion in 2018 (see the exhibit “Income Projections”) , mainly reflecting 
reduced interest income resulting from the reduction in SOMA se curities holdings.  Total 
interest expense is projected t o be $43 billion this year, litt le changed from 2018.8 
Remittances are expected to remain at $50 billion next year, an d then rise, reflecting an 
increase in net interest income associated with a growing balan ce sheet.  The projected 
path for remittances is generall y a bit lower than in the June Tealbook, reflecting the 
lower MBS coupon income resulting from the faster projected pac e of MBS 
prepayments.  
The path for remittances implied by the “Earlier End to Runoff”  scenario is 
similar to that in the baselin e projection, even as underlying interest income and expense 
slightly differ through 2022, with t he differences in interest income and expense roughly 
offsetting each other.  As shown in the middle right panel of t he exhibit “Income 
Projections,” annual remittances are projected to rise graduall y from around 0.22 percent 
of nominal GDP next year to ju st below 0.3 percent by the end o f the projection horizon. 
Unrealized gains or losses.  The SOMA portfolio was i n a net unrealized gain 
position of about $137 billion at the end of June.9  With longer-term interest rates 
                                                 
reflects the projected maturity d istribution of Treasury securi ties outstanding at that time, and is based on 
updated assumptions about Treasury issuance.  This adjustment h as little material implications for the 
trajectory of the Treasury port folio’s weighted-average duratio n. 
8 The effects on total interest expense of the increase in the I OER over 2018 and the decrease in 
reserves this year approximately  offset each other.  The projec tion for interest expen se is also based on a 
fairly flat path for the IOER th is year.  Meanwhile, we continu e to assume that the FOMC will set a 
25 basis point-wide target range  for the federal funds rate throughout the projection period.  Consistent with 
the FOMC’s May 2019 Implementation Note, we assume that the IOER will be set 15 basis points below 
the top of the target range, and the offering rate on overnight  RRPs will be set at the bottom of the range. 
9 See the Tealbook B box titled “W hat Does It Mean for the SOMA Portfolio to Be in an 
‘Unrealized Loss’ Position?” (Jun e 2018) for an explanation of the accounting concepts underlying  
unrealized and realized gain an d loss positions, as well as the ir implications for the Federal Reserve’s 
ability to meet its obligations.

 projected to rise, the unrealized gain position is expected to decline over the next couple 
of years before turning into an unrealized loss position by mid -2021.  The position 
bottoms out at around a $70 billi on unrealized loss in 2025:Q1.   Compared with the June 
Tealbook, the path for the unrealized position of the SOMA port folio is moderately 
higher over the next several year s reflecting the lower path for longer-term interest rates. 
Total term premium effect .  As shown in the table “Projections for the 10-Year 
Treasury Total Term Premium Effect (TTPE),” under the baseline scenario, the securities 
held in the SOMA portfolio are e stimated to be reducing the ter m premium embedded in 
the 10-year Treasury yield by about  130 basis points in the cur rent quarter.  Over the 
projection horizon, the magnitude  of the downward pressure exerted on the term 
premium in longer-term Treasury y ields is estimated to diminish  gradually.  The gradual 
decline reflects both the projected decrease in the duration of  the Federal Reserve’s 
securities holdings and the proj ected continued decrease in the  size of the SOMA 
portfolio relative to nominal GDP through the fourth quarter of  2021.10  Over the next 
decade, the average projected pace of decline in the TTPE is ab out 3 basis points per year 
so that, at the end of 2030, the tot al term premium effect of the SOMA portfolio on the 
10-year Treasury yield is estim ated to be less than 100 basis points.  The contour for the 
TTPE is virtually unchanged from that in the June projection.  
Under the “Earlier End to Runoff” s cenario, the TTPE is just a few basis points 
more negative than in the base line projection over the next 4 y ears, with the difference 
reflecting the slightly larger securities holdings and the high er trajectory for the 
weighted-average duration of  the Treasury portfolio. 
                                                 
10 The TTPE calculations implicitly assume that any change in the  weighted-average duration of 
the Federal Reserve’s Treasury securities holdings results in a  corresponding change (in the opposite 
direction) in the weighted-average duration of Treasury securit ies held by the private sector.
