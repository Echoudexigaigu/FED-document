 Monetary Policy Alternatives 
The alternative policy statemen ts presented below offer a range  of options for the 
setting of the current stance  of policy and for communications regarding the likely near-
term path of monetary policy.  Alt ernative B, like the Committee’s July postmeeting 
statement, points to the implicat ions of global developments for the economic outlook, 
along with muted inflation pressure s, as reasons for a modest r eduction in the  level of the 
federal funds rate at this mee ting.  Under this alternative, th e Committee would lower the 
target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, and would note that this 
action supports its view that su stained expansion of economic a ctivity, strong labor 
market conditions, and inflation ne ar the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective 
remain the most likely outcome s.  Even so, Alternative B acknow ledges that uncertainties 
about the outlook remain.  The Committee would continue to note  that, as it 
“contemplates” the future path f or the federal funds rates, it will “act as appropriate” to 
help attain its preferred outcomes.   
Alternative C maintains the current target range for the federa l funds rate.  It 
expresses the view that the cu rrent stance of policy is consist ent with sustained expansion 
of economic activity, strong la bor market conditions, and infla tion near the Committee’s 
symmetric 2 percent objective as t he most likely outcomes, whil e acknowledging 
lingering uncertainties about thi s outlook.  However, Alternati ve C alters si gnificantly the 
policy message associated wit h the July FOMC meeting, dropping explicit reference to 
global developments and mute d inflation pressures as having imp lications for the 
Committee’s outlook or for the appropriate path for policy.  As  in Alternative B, the text 
of Alternative C states that the Committee will “act as appropr iate” to sustain its 
preferred outcomes as it “contemplates” future settings of the federal funds rate.   
Alternative A gives an assessment of the incoming data that is much the same as 
Alternative B, except that mar ket-based measures of inflation compensation are said to 
“have declined” in Alternative A.  In describing the economic conditions expected to 
prevail in the period ahead, Alternative A has the same outlook  as Alternative B—albeit 
conditioned on a more vigorous pol icy response.  Specifically, under Alternative A the 
Committee would lower the target range for the federal funds ra te by ½ percentage point, 
citing inflation running “persiste ntly” below 2 percent as a principal reason.

By removing the “contemplates” language, Alternative A also signals greater openness to 
additional reductions in the policy rate.  
With regard to the specifics of the language in Alternatives A,  B, and C: 
The assessment of the incoming data:
oThe three alternatives have identical descriptions of the incom ing data with
respect to the labor market and economic activity.  In particul ar, all three
continue to portray the labor  market as strong, while noting th at the
unemployment rate remains low a nd that average job gains in rec ent months
have been solid .  They also describe growth in economic activity as
“moderate,” characterize house hold spending as having risen at a strong pace,
and note that business fixed investment and exports “have weake ned.”
oThe alternatives continue to note that “overall inflation and inflation for items
other than food and energy are running below 2 percent.”  With regard to
inflation expectations, Alterna tives B and C say, as did the Ju ly statement, that
market-based measures of inflation compensation “remain low.”  By contrast,Alternative A asserts that inf lation compensation has “declined.”  All three
alternatives continue to indicate that survey-based measures of  longer-term
inflation expectations are “little changed.”
The outlook for economic activity and inflation:
oThe outlook for economic activit y, the labor market, and inflat ion is the same
under all three altern atives and is unchange d from the July FOM C statement.
The three alternatives only differ in the paths for the target range of the federal
funds rate that are regarded as a ppropriate to achieve the Comm ittee’s
objectives.
For the current policy decision and the outlook for policy:
oAlternative B lowers t he target range for the federal funds rate by
¼ percentage point.  The language a ssociated with this action i s otherwise
unchanged from what appeared in t he July postmeeting statement.   Alternative
A lowers the target range by ½ percentage point while Alternative C leaves
the target range unchanged.
oRegarding the outlook for policy, A lternatives B and C retain t he language
from the July postmeeting statement that, as the Committee “con templates the

future path” for the federal funds rate, it will “monitor” inco ming information.   
The minutes of the July meeting indicated that the “contemplate s” language 
was added to the statement “to underscore the Committee’s inten tion to 
carefully assess incoming information before deciding on future  policy 
adjustments.”  Hence by dropping the “contemplates” language an d stating 
that the Committee will “closel y monitor” the incoming data, Al ternative A 
signals a greater likelihood that further accommodation may become 
appropriate.  Finally, all thr ee alternatives continue to state  that the Committee 
“will act as appropriate” to achieve favorable outcomes.

JULY 2019  FOMC  STATEMENT  
1.Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in June
indicates that the labor marke t remains strong and that economi c activity has been
rising at a moderate rate.  J ob gains have been solid, on avera ge, in recent months,
and the unemployment rate has  remained low.  Although growth of  household
spending has picked up from earlie r in the year, growth of busi ness fixed
investment has been soft.  On a  12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for
items other than food and ener gy are running below 2 percent.  Market-based
measures of inflation compensati on remain low; survey-based mea sures of
longer-term inflati on expectations are  little changed.
2.Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum
employment and price stability.  I n light of the implications o f global
developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflatio n pressures, the
Committee decided to lower the tar get range for the federal funds rate to 2 to 2-
1/4 percent.  This action supports the Committee’s view that su stained expansion
of economic activity, strong la bor market conditions, and infla tion near the
Committee’s symmetric 2 percent ob jective are the most likely o utcomes, but
uncertainties about this outlook remain.  As the Committee contemplates the
future path of the target range  for the federal funds rate, it will continue to
monitor the implications of incom ing information for the econom ic outlook and
will act as appropriate to sustain  the expansion, with a strong  labor market and
inflation near its symme tric 2 percent objective.
3.In determining the timing and size  of future adjustments to the  target range for the
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expe cted economic
conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its  symmetric 2
percent inflation objective.  Thi s assessment will take into account a wide range
of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of
inflation pressures and inflati on expectations, and readings on  financial and
international developments.
4.The Committee will conclude the  reduction of its aggregate secu rities holdings in
the System Open Market Account in August, two months earlier than previouslyindicated.

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OUTLOOK  
 The staff projects that real GDP growth will slow from about 2½ percent in the first 
half of 2019 to about 1¾ percent i n the second half, despite no table strength in 
consumer spending.     
 Resurgent trade tensions and w eakness among foreign economies h ave adversely 
affected manufacturing, busine ss fixed investment, and exports in the United States.  
According to the staff’s assessm ent, uncertainty regarding trad e policy and 
geopolitical events are sources of downward pressure on domestic real activity.   
 Compared with the July Tealbook projection, the global outlook is weaker, the 
exchange value of the dollar is h igher, corporate earnings expe ctations have declined, 
and equity prices are lower; th ese developments are only partly offset by lower 
interest rates and higher estimat es of personal income.  As a result, the medium-term 
Tealbook outlook is somewhat weaker than in July. 
 The staff has reevaluated its ass essment of the level of resour ce utilization, both in 
terms of the labor market and out put.  This reassessment leaves  the output gap about 
½ percentage point lower than it would have been, all else equa l.  Similarly, the staff 
has reduced its estimate of the natural ra te of unemployment by  0.2 percentage point 
to 4.4 percent.  
 Available data indicate that the  labor market continued to tigh ten so far this year, but 
at a more gradual pace than in 2018. 
o Payrolls rose 130,000 in August, les s than what the staff expected but still 
above the pace that the staff es timates to be consistent with n o change in 
resource utilization.  For the three months ending in August, p ayroll gains 
averaged 155,000 per month, down fro m a monthly average of 223,000 in 
2018.  With GDP projected to decele rate over the medium term, t he staff 
expects payroll gains to slow.  
o The unemployment rate held steady at 3.7 percent in August, as anticipated, 
and is projected to remain at that rate through the end of the year.  The labor 
force participation rate tic ked up to 63.2 percent.  Since the beginning of 
2016, labor force participation has been remarkably stable at a round 63 
percent despite the demographi cally driven downward trend in participation 
over this period.

o Average hourly earnings rose 3.2 percent over the 12 months end ing in 
August, and are projected to contin ue to grow at a similar pace  over the 
coming months.  The employment cost index for July increased 2.6 percent 
over the 12 months ending in June .  Meanwhile, new data on comp ensation 
per hour show four-quarter gr owth of 4.4 percent through the second quarter 
of 2019, although some of this in crease may be due to bonuses a nd the 
exercise of stock options.  
 Inflation remains subdued despit e the unemployment rate having run at or below 4 
percent for well over a year.  
o Headline inflation has continued to run below the Committee’s symmetric 
2 percent objective and core PCE inflation has also been below 2 percent.   On 
the whole, indicators for core  inflation over th e intermeeting period have 
come in close to staff expectations .  Inflation is expected  to move up later this 
year, as the effects of idiosync ratic and temporary factors that held down 
inflation earlier in the year diss ipate and core inflation is t emporarily boosted 
by the effects of tariff increases. 
o Core PCE prices increased 1.6 per cent over the 12 months ending  in July.  
The staff projects this measur e of inflation to rise to 1.8 per cent by October 
and remain at this level  through the end of the year.  Total PCE prices rose 
1.4 percent over the 12 months e nding in July and are forecast to move up at a 
12-month pace of 1.6 percent in De cember, as notably lower consumer energy 
prices outweigh the anticipated i ncrease in core inflation and an expected 
acceleration in food prices over the second half of the year .  
o With the acceleration in compensation per hour and folding in t he data on 
productivity growth, unit labor co sts are now estimated to have  risen 
2.6 percent over the four quart ers ending in the second quarter  of 2019, 
somewhat faster than the 1.9 percent rate posted for the same p eriod a year 
earlier.  
o Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are  little changed 
since the July FOMC  meeting .  Market-based measures of inflation 
compensation declined and are clo se to their lowest levels of t his year.   
 Financial market developments  over m
ost of the intermeeting per iod were dominated 
by resurgent trade policy uncerta inty, global growth concerns, and expectations of 
more-accommodative monetary policy both domestically and abroad .  Treasury yields

tumbled amid falling rates oversea s and increased global demand  for low-risk assets, 
with some bounce back in recent days.1  Equity prices decline d notably early in the 
intermeeting period but have made  up much of those losses since  that time. 
o As of the close of Tealbook B, the yield curve had inverted for Treasury 
maturities ranging out to about four years. 
o Statistical models used to estimate the probability of a recess ion within four 
quarters have generally shown inc reases in probabilities over t he intermeeting 
period.  The staff model that empl oys the spread between the 10 -year and 3-
month Treasury rates as the so le recession indicator shows a 66 percent 
probability as of the close of Tealbook A, while the model that  uses a 
weighted average of a selection of conditioning variables gives  a 45 percent 
probability.  Probabilities from models that use the “excess bo nd premium” or 
the term premium, in addition to t he yield spread, as well as m odels that are 
based principally on macroeconomic variables, show significantl y lower 
probabilities.2 
 Foreign GDP increased at about a 2 percent annual rate in the s econd quarter.  The 
staff outlook is for foreign economic growth to be about flat o ver the second half of 
the year, before recovering mode stly in 2020—a projection that is somewhat weaker 
than in the July Tealbook.   The staff regards relativel y benign resolutions of key 
uncertain developments on the int ernational front as the most l ikely outcomes, but its 
assessment of downside risks has increased.3  
 The staff continues to judge that the risks to i ts outlook for U.S. GDP growth are 
tilted to the downside over the next year, as well as further o ut.  Uncertainties related 
to trade policies, Brexit nego tiations, and foreign economic de velopments—along 
with the potential for adverse reactions in financial markets to these risks—could

rates. 
2 See the exhibit “Assessment of K ey Macroeconomic Risks” and di scussion in the Risks and 
Uncertainty section of Tealbook A, pp. 81 82.  The “excess bond premium” is the compensation in excess 
of the expected losses from default that investors demand in or der to agree to hold risky corporate bonds.

concerns Brexit while the other deals with trade tensions.

    Monetary  Policy Expectations  and Uncertainty  
Expectations  for the path  of the federal funds  rate shifted  down notably, on net, over 
the intermeeting  period and were especially  responsive to news  related to 
international  trade tensions.   Financial  market prices as well as results from the Desk’s 
September  surveys currently  suggest a high likelihood  of a 25‐ basis‐point reduction in  
the target range  for the federal  funds rate at the  September  FOMC meeting.  
Figure 1 shows the market‐implied probab ility 
distribution  of the federal funds  rate 
following  the September  2019 meeting,  as derived from the  most recent quotes on 
options prices and not adjusted  for risk  premiums.   The distribution  shifted to the left 
and 
ended the period  placing about 65 percent odds on  a 25‐  basis point decline in the 
target range  at the September  meeting.   However,  the distribution  also attached  
about 25 percent probability  to a 50‐ basis point reduction in  the target range and  
about 10 percent  odds to no  change.1  The corresponding  average probability  
distribution  from the September  Desk surveys (figure 2) shows that survey 
respondents  assigned  on average around 15 percent probability  to a 50 basis  point 
reduction in  the target range,  80 percent probability  to a 25 basis  point reduction,  and 
a 5 percent  probability  to no change. 
The option ‐impli e d probability  distribution  of the federal funds  rate for the end  of 
2019 (figure 3) also shifted toward lower values.  It currently  suggests  that the federal 
funds rate is most likely to end the year  in the 1.5 to 1.75  percent range, although  it 
also assigns considerable odds to  the 1.25 t0 1.5 percent range.   Likewise, the  
corresponding  year‐ end probability  distr
ibution from the September  Desk surveys 
(figure 4) has shifted lower compared  with the July surveys.  It too is now centered  on 
the 1.5 to 1.75  percent range, with respondents  placing, on  average,  about 40 percent 
probability  to that outcome, while  assigning  about 20 and 30 percent probability  to 
the 1.25 to 1. 5 and 1.75 to 2 percent ranges, respectively.  The differences  between  the 
market‐implied and survey‐implied distribution  likely reflect, in part, negative  risk 
premiums and  liquidity premiums  embedded in  the option quotes.  
Figure 5 compares  various measures  of the expected  federal funds  rate path over  the 
next few years.   On net over 
the intermeeting  period, financial market measures  of 
the expected  federal funds  rate declined  notably.  A straight  read of forward rates  
derived from  overnight index  swaps (the blue lines) declined  by 17 and 22 basis points 
for end‐2019 and end‐2020, respectively.   These unadju sted 
forward rates  now 
                                                 
1 Probabilities  calculated  from binomial tree models,  such as Bloomberg’s  WIRP function,  show 
a substantially  smaller  likelihood  of a 50‐basis‐point  cut at the September  meeting.  This  is a result of 
WIRP’s  methodology  using futures prices, which allows  for the calculation  of probabilities  for only 
two  alternative  policy rate decisions  at the next FOMC meeting.   WIRP  currently  sets  these to be 
either a 25‐ or a 50‐basis‐point rate cut, thereby ignoring any
 other possibilities.   By contrast,  while 
the option‐implied distribution  assigns higher probability  to a 50‐basis‐point  reduction  at the 
September  meeting,  it also assigns probability  to a third outcom e of no chang e.  For  further  details, 
see the memo  to the Board by Dobrislav  P. Dobrev, Don H. Kim and Marcel A. Priebsch (2019)

of the current year and  an additional  41 basis points in 2020.  For  comparison,  the

increasing  since the middle  of last year, although  the increase between the

2 According  to the survey responses,  the most likely timing of declines in the target  range 
during the remainder  of this year are the September  and December  FOMC meetings,  each with a 25

surveys when the modal expectations  beyond the  July FOMC meeting were for a single 25 basis

showed that the level of the federal funds rate for the fourth quarter of 2019 (as well as the  first

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
Over the course of the year, trade policy tensions have mounted  and global 
growth has weakened, materia lly affecting the U.S. economy.  Th ese factors and 
uncertainties surrounding them c ontinue to pose risks to the ec onomic outlook.  The 
period since the Committee met at  the end of July has featured “more of the same,” with 
some further deterioration in the global outlook, increased tra de policy uncertainty and 
some tightening in financi al market conditions.  
Economic activity expanded at a solid pace during the first hal f of this year, but at 
present the expansion owes mainly to strong household spending, with business fixed 
investment and exports increasi ngly showing the effects of weak er foreign growth and 
trade uncertainties.  Financial m arkets reacte d strongly to new s over the intermeeting 
period about trade and other gl obal developments.  With bond yields falling significantly 
over the last few months not just in the United States, but glo bally, policymakers may be 
alert to downside risks. 
Policymakers might note the toll that trade and international f actors have already 
taken on the U.S. economy, with decelerating business fixed inv estment and exports over 
the past year, on balance, culminating in outright declines in the second quarter, and with 
growth in manufacturing  output having turned negative.4  At the same time, with inflation 
pressures still muted, and contin uing indications of low longer -term inflation 
expectations, policymakers may be  concerned that  inflation is taking too long to return to 
the Committee’s symmetric 2 per cent objective o n a sustained basis.   In these 
circumstances, policymakers may determine that a second, modest  easing in the stance of 
monetary policy this year is appropriate.  
Under Alternative B, policymaker s would communicate much the sa me message 
regarding the rationale for the ir policy action as they did in the July statement.  Indeed, 
the text of Alternative B diffe rs very little from the July pos tmeeting statement.  In 
particular, they would continue t o state that, “in light of the implications of global 
developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflatio n pressures,” the 
Committee would lower the target range for the federal funds ra te to 1¾ to 2 percent .     
4 For a discussion of the connecti on between global trade tensio ns, manufacturing output and 
business fixed investment in a global context see the box “Weak ness in the Global Manufacturing Sector” 
in the International Economic Developments and Outlook section of Tealbook A, pp. 40-41.

Policymakers may judge that ther e is little discernible upward pressure on price 
inflation, with nominal wage growth remaining moderate, despite  the fact that labor 
market conditions remain strong—inc luding the very low unemploy ment rate and solid 
job gains in recent months .  Alternatively, they may reg ard the effects of resource 
utilization on price inflation as too modest to be of concern.  
Even though data for the last fe w months on consumer prices exc luding food and 
energy have been firmer than readings from earlier in the year,  inflation has continued to 
run below the Committee’s 2 percent objective.  In addition,  indicators of longer-term 
inflation expectations remain l ow, with market-based measures of inflation compensation 
having declined over the intermeeting period.   To the extent that policymakers fear that a 
continued shortfall of inflati on could result in a deterioratio n in inflation expectations, 
they may choose a somewhat more accommodative monetary policy s tance, along the 
lines of Alternative B, to forestall that outcome.   
Policymakers may also concur with t he staff view that the risks  to the outlook for 
economic activity and inflation a re weighted to the downside mo stly because of trade 
policy uncertainty and concerns a bout global growth.  They migh t observe that several 
staff models suggest that the  probability of recession within a  year show higher 
probabilities than earlier in the year.  On that basis, policym akers may judge that the risks 
to the outlook warrant the provision of additional accommodatio n in the near term on 
risk-management grounds.  They mig ht also note the asymmetry as sociated with those 
risks: Should the risks abate, a nd economic activity and inflat ion turn out to be stronger 
than expected, the Committee would have the means to manage tha t situation with 
changes in the policy rate, wher eas the converse is less likely to be true in light of the 
proximity of the policy rate to its effective lower bound.       
Should policymakers choose policy communications along the line s of 
Alternative B, financial market responses would likely be relatively modest.  Market 
prices and responses to the Desk’s  latest surveys of primary de alers and market 
participants currently indicate that a reduction in the target range by 25 basis points at the 
September meeting is widely vie wed as the most likely outcome.  The nearly unchanged 
language associated with the rat e cut would probably be viewed as in line with market 
participants’ perceptions o f the outlook for policy.

 THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C  
If policymakers do not yet see much evidence that global develo pments are 
significantly degrading the ec onomic outlook, they may prefer to maintain the current 
target range.  Indeed, they might  take some encouragement from recent indicators that 
suggest that the domestic economy a s a whole has been resilient  to economic 
disturbances affecti ng the trade-intensive manufacturing sector .  Thus, they may also 
elect to omit the reference to “ implications of global developm ents for the economic 
outlook” that appeared in the J uly postmeeting statement, as in  Alternative C.   
Policymakers may observe that, while overall output growth in t he second quarter 
moderated, private domestic fina l purchases—usually regarded as  a more reliable 
measure of underlying trends in a ggregate spending—was stronger than staff had 
anticipated.  They may expect t hat, with household spending pic king up markedly from 
earlier in the year, growth will  be near potential over the rem ainder of 2019.  They may 
also take note of recent economic  indicators, including still-h ealthy readings on consumer 
sentiment in August, strong light  motor vehicle sales in August, and the solid gains in 
payroll employment and income i n the last few months.  These factors may lead 
policymakers to conclude that the solid economic outlook they p roject is consistent with 
maintaining current levels of monetary accommodation. 
 Policymakers may observe that the softness in inflation readin gs in the first half 
of the year appears to have b een temporary, as they had expecte d.  They may also note 
that compensation per hour for t he first half of the year came in notably higher than 
expected and that the last sev eral months’ observations for ave rage hourly earnings have 
also been a bit stronger than consensus.  Policymakers may ther efore be increasingly 
confident that the usual channels connecting hig h levels of res ource utilization to stronger 
wage growth and higher price inflation are beginning to manifes t themselves.  
Policymakers may also perceive an increased likelihood that cur rent and expected tariff-
induced increases in prices will provide some lift to inflation , at least in the short run.  In 
addition, they may judge that recent declines in market-based m easures of inflation 
compensation were driven by safe haven flows of investment and therefore not indicative 
of lower expected inflation.  The y might therefore be confident that, under the current 
stance of monetary policy, inflati on will rise to the Committee ’s 2 percent objective over 
the medium term.

Policymakers may view current financial conditions as highly ac commodative.  
They might note the magnitude of the easing in financial condit ions so far this year, as 
exemplified by the approximately 1 pe rcentage point decline in the 10-year Treasury rate 
since the start of the year, and a rgue that the effects of much  of that easing have yet to 
show through to expenditures.  The y might further note that the  volatility in financial 
markets in recent weeks has had little impact on financing cond itions for corporations.  
They may view monetary policy and a ssociated discussions as imp ortant determinants of 
financial conditions, irrespective of macroeconomic fundamental s, and be concerned 
about perceptions of a feedback loop between market expectation s of monetary policy 
and policy itself.  They might als o note that, while some of th e recession probability 
models reported by the staff a nd others show an increased likelihood of a recession in the 
next year, that inference may be f ragile, as alternative models , which either include the 
excess bond premium or correct for  unusually low term premiums,  do not show 
particularly high rec ession probabilities. 
Policymakers may regard persistent ly low interest rates and eas y financial 
conditions more generally as exace rbating vulnerabilities to fi nancial stability.  For 
example, they may see valuation pr essures in leveraged loan and  commercial real estate 
markets as worryingly high or regard the recent outsized declin e in longer-term interest 
rates around the world as i ndicative of a bond market bubble.  Putting all these 
considerations together, they might judge that financial stabil ity considerations strengthen 
the case for leaving the target range unchanged.  
The policy action in Alternative C would be i nconsistent with t he widely-held 
market expectation of a reduction in the target range for the f ederal funds rate at the 
upcoming meeting.  Consequently, A lternative C would likely res ult in a significant 
repricing in financial markets .  Market expectations for the pa th of short-term interest 
rates would probably shift up.  Equity prices and inflation compensation would likely 
fall.  Although policymakers may view some revisions to market expectations as 
warranted, the apparent inconsis tency of Alternative C with rec ent Federal Reserve 
communications could cause conf usion among investors about the Committee’s 
intentions.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Policymakers may view risks to the economic outlook as significantly weighted to 
the downside, or worry about t he ongoing weakness in inflation and inflation 
expectations.  If so, they may deem it appropriate to provide a greater degree of monetary 
policy accommodation at this meeting than would be the case und er Alternative B in 
order to sustain the economic expansion and achieve a durable return of inflation to the 
Committee’s symmetric 2 percent ob jective.  From a risk-managem ent perspective, they 
may judge that a larger cut in th e target range for the federal  funds rate could help 
cushion the effects on the econom y of possible adverse shocks.  With Alternative A, 
policymakers would communicate that, in light of “the implicati ons of global 
developments for the economi c outlook as well as inflation runn ing persistently below 
2 percent,” the Committee would reduce the target range by 50 basis points.  Alternative A would also drop the “contemplate” language from the July statement and would say that the Committee intends to “cl osely monitor” incoming inform ation, thereby indicating 
preparedness to make further adjustments to policy.   
With inflation continuing to run pe rsistently below the Committ ee’s symmetric 
2 percent objective, several sur vey-based measures of inflation  expectations near the 
lower end of their historical ra nges, and market-based measures of inflation 
compensation having declined furth er during the intermeeting pe riod, policymakers may 
be concerned that inflation exp ectations have already moved bel ow levels consistent with 
the Committee’s 2 percent objective.  They may therefore see si gnificant risks that 
inflation could fail to return to 2 percent on a sustained basi s.  They may concur with the 
staff’s reassessment that resource utilization is not as tight as conventionally thought and 
thus that the risk of an outbreak of inflation is low.  They might also note the weak reading for private-sector job ga ins in the August payroll repo rt and further argue that the 
preliminary benchmark revision t o payrolls will reduce estimate d payroll gains from 
April 2018 to March 2019 which, all else equal, suggests less price pressures in the 
pipeline than otherwise.5  They may judge that the string of underpredictions of the labor 
force participation rate by for ecasters over the past few years  indicates that the labor 
market has more room to run without inducing an undue increase in inflation.  
Policymakers might also argue that with longer-term inflation e xpectations as low as they

implications of these revisions, which are preliminary; the fin al revisions are not expected until February.

appear to be, it could be helpful if inflation were to move mod estly above 2 percent for a 
time, as that could help re-cente r inflation expectations on th e 2 percent objective.     
Policymakers may judge that, in the absence of a countervailing  policy response, 
current and prospective global developments and trade policy un certainty and their 
financial market repercussions , will weigh heavily on the econo mic outlook.  They may 
also judge that, with many policy authorities apparently not we ll positioned to provide 
support for worldwide demand, the  global economy is in a fragil e state.  They may view 
the heightened sensitivity of asset prices to news as evidence of this fragility and judge 
that the ambiguities underlyi ng the current situation are not l ikely to be resolved 
favorably any time soon.  They might also point to recession-pr obability models that 
show a marked increase over recen t months in the estimated like lihood of a recession in 
the next year.  More generall y, policymakers might regard the c ontinued decline in bond 
yields, domestic and foreign, as a signal of a downward trend i n the equilibrium real 
interest rate.  In the same vein, they might judge that in ligh t of the proximity of the 
policy rate to its effective lo wer bound, policymakers should act vigorously when 
confronted with such risks.   
Current indications are that a statement such as Alternative A would likely be 
seen by market participants as implying a more accommodative pa th for the policy rate 
than had been anticipated, which t ogether with the language of “inflation running 
persistently below 2 percent,” would likely induce market expec tations for future settings 
of the federal funds rate to fa ll.  If market participants inte rpreted Alternative A as a 
move to a more accommodative po licy reaction function, then equ ity prices and inflation 
compensation would likely rise .  The effect on the dollar would  be ambiguous, with 
lower real rates and higher future inflation pointing to depreciation, but stronger 
economic activity suggesting the  opposite.  However in the even t that market participants 
interpreted Alterna tive A as a bleaker r eading of the outlook f or activity and inflation 
than they had been expecting, equity prices would likely fall together with the exchange value of the dollar, and possi bly inflation compensation.

holdings of Treasury securities and to continue  reinvest ing all principal 
payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and  agency 
mortgage-backed securities receiv ed during each calendar month.  
Principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage-backed 
securities up to $20 billion per month will continue to be reinvested in 
Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition o f Treasury 
securities outstandi ng; principal payments in excess of $20 bil lion per 
month will continue to be reinvested in agency mortgage-backed securities.  Small deviations from these amounts for operational reasons are acceptable.   
The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll an d coupon 
swap transactions as necessary t o facilitate settlement of the Federal 
Reserve’s agency mortgage-b acked securities transactions.”

Balance Sheet and Income Projections 
The staff has prepared projecti ons of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the 
associated income statement that  are consistent with the projections in Tealbook A.1    
The September baseline projecti on includes paths for interest r ates that are 
generally lower than in the July Tealbook.  Through the end of 2021, the 10-year 
Treasury yield is, on average, a bout 45 basis points lower, whi le the path for the 30-year 
fixed mortgage rate was rev ised down roughly 40 basis points.  These revisions imply 
higher agency MBS prepayment activity than projected in July, w hich in turn leads to 
more reinvestments into agency MBS in 2019 and 2020, as prepayments are expected to 
exceed reinvestment caps th rough the end of this year.  
Reserve balances.  Reserves are projected to decl ine over the fourth quarter, 
driven largely by forecasted increases in the Treasury General Account (TGA).  In light 
of the resolution of the debt ceiling and Treasury’s plans to r ebuild the TGA, we expect 
the TGA to be roughly $400 billion by year end, about $120 bill ion higher than projected 
in the July Tealbook.  Once the TGA is replenished to meet Treasury’s stated target 
balance, reserves should decrea se gradually reflecting growth in nonreserve liabilities.2  
We are now projecting that the lev el of reserves at the end of 2019 will be about 
$160 billion lower than in the July Tealbook, and that it will remain generally near 
$1.2 trillion through the  first quarter of 2020.3  We continue to assume that once reserves 
reach $1 trillion—which is currentl y projected to be at the beginning of the third quarter 
of 2021—they will begin growing in line with nominal GDP.4   
1 In this Tealbook, for convenience, we provide a comparison of our projections to those from the 
July Tealbook’s alternative scenar io labeled “Earlier End to Runoff,” in which it was assumed that the 
reduction in total securities holdings would have concluded by August 1, as was subsequently decided by 
the FOMC at its July 30-31 meeting. 
2 We assume that liability items o ther than currency, reserves, and the TGA, such as the foreign 
repo pool and DFMU balances, grow in line with nominal GDP from  the start of the projection period.  
3 To account for the eff ects of Treasury debt  management on the projected path of reserves, we 
incorporated the staff’s near-ter m forecast for the TGA balance s for the next two quarters. This assumption 
replaces that from the July Tealbook in which the TGA balance a t the start of the projection period was set 
to the most recent three-month historical average, excluding th ose months within debt-limit episodes. 
4 As discussed in the March FOMC memo “Transitioning to an Ample  Reserves Regime with 
Lower Reserves,” the actual level of reserves prevailing when t he decline in reserves ceases is uncertain 
and will need to be determined in  light of information regardin g banks’ reserve demand.

 Evolution of the SOMA portfolio .  Reinvestments into Treasury securities are 
expected to average roughly $140 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019.  Of this, 
$80 billion will come from rollovers of maturing Treasury secur ities and roughly 
$60 billion will come from redemp tions of agency securities that are reinvested into 
Treasury securities (see the tabl e in the exhibit titled “SOMA Reinvestments”).  
Reinvestments of principal paymen ts from agency securities into  MBS are estimated to 
be $25 billion in 2019, and $8 billion in 2020.  For the last four months of 2019, 
reinvestments of agency securi ties into MBS are expected to be $14 billion higher than in 
the July Tealbook as a result of t he lower projected path for the mortgage rate.  Through 
2021, cumulative reinvestment into Treasury securities of princ ipal payments from 
holdings of agency securities i s expected to be about $495 bill ion.  
By the time the balance sheet runoff concluded at the end of Ju ly, the size of the 
SOMA portfolio was roughly $3.6 trillion, consisting of about $ 2.1 trillion of Treasury 
securities and $1.5 tri llion of agency securities (see the exhi bit titled “Total Assets and 
Selected Balance Sheet Items”).  T he balance sheet is currently about 17 percent of 
nominal GDP, compared to about 5 percent over the decade prior to the crisis and a peak 
value of about 25 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014.5   
The share of agency MBS in the S OMA portfolio, which currently stands at 
42 percent, is expected to decline to about 16 percent by the e nd of 2025, slightly lower 
than the July projection (see the exhibit titled “Federal Reser ve Balance Sheet Month-end 
Projections – September Tealbook”). 
SOMA portfolio characteristics.   The weighted-average  duration of the SOMA 
Treasury portfolio is currently nearly seven years (see the top  panel of the exhibit titled 
“Projections for the Character istics of SOMA Treasury Securities Holdings”).  Duration 
is projected to stay roughly constant until the decline in rese rve balances ends and the 
SOMA portfolio begins to expand again.6  As in the July Tealbook, we assume that once 
the decline in reserve balances  ends, rollovers of maturing Tre asury securities will 
                                                 
5 Liabilities plus Federal Reserve  Bank capital equals total ass ets, which include the SOMA 
securities portfolio and also ite ms such as unamortized premium s and discounts, and other assets. 
6 We assume that rollovers of ma turing Treasury securities will be allocated across newly issued 
securities at Treasury auctions on a pro-rata basis in proporti on with the amounts being issued.  Consistent 
with the Desk’s interim plan for reinvesting principal payments  from agency debt an d MBS into Treasury 
securities once the balance sheet runoff ceases, we also assume  that these purchases will be spread across 
the Treasury maturity spectrum, in line with the amounts outsta nding in each residua l maturity sector.

 continue to be directed to newly i ssued securities at Treasury auctions in proportion to the 
maturity distribution of Treasury d ebt issued at the time of ro llover.  Additionally, we 
continue to assume that seconda ry-market purchases of Treasury securities aimed at 
reinvesting principal payments  received from agency securities holdings and at 
accommodating growth in Federal Res erve liabilities will be dir ected entirely towards 
Treasury bills until bills comprise approximately one-third of the Treasury portfolio, 
close to the pre-crisis composition.7     
The process of rebuilding the  Treasury bill portion of the SOMA  portfolio is 
expected to take just under 5 year s from the time the portfolio  starts expanding again, 
leading to a gradual reduction in the weighted-average duration  of the Treasury portfolio 
to less than 5 years.  Thereafter, further secondary-market purchases of Treasury 
securities are assumed to be spread  across the maturity spectru m of outstanding Treasury 
debt (see the bottom panel of the  exhibit).  Relative to the Ju ly Tealbook, the decline in 
the weighted-average duration i s expected to occur sooner, reflecting an earlier start of 
the purchases of Treasury securi ties that are assumed to be entirely directed towards bills.  
Federal Reserve remittances.  Remittances to the Treasury are projected to 
decline to $53 billion this  year from $65 billion in 2018 (see the exhibit titled “Income 
Projections”).  This reduction mai nly reflects reduced interest  income resulting from the 
reduction in SOMA securities hold ings, with total interest expe nse projected to be 
$42 billion this year, little changed from 2018.8  Remittances are expected to be 
$53 billion next year, and then to rise, reflecting an increase  in net interest income 
associated with a growing bala nce sheet.  The projected path fo r remittances is higher 
than in the July Tealbook, reflect ing both lower interest expen se resulting from the 
downward revision to the federal funds rate path and higher int erest income.9  
                                                 
7 As the Committee has not yet reac hed a decision on the long-ru n composition of the SOMA 
portfolio, we retain this purchas e assumption in our projection s.   
8 The effects on total interest expense of the increase in the I OER over 2018 and o f the decrease in 
reserves this year approximate ly offset each other.  Meanwhile, we continue to assu me that the FOMC will 
set a 25 basis point-wide target range for the federal funds ra te throughout the projection period.  
Consistent with the FOMC’s May 2019 Implementation Note, we assume that the IOER will be set 
15 basis points below the top of the target range, and the offe ring rate on overnight RRPs will be set at the 
bottom of the range. 
9 The higher path of interest income is primarily due to a techn ical revision to the accounting 
methodology for Treasury coupon income from maturing securities .

 Unrealized gains or losses.  The SOMA portfolio was i n a net unrealized gain 
position of about $233 billion at the end of August.10  With longer-term interest rates 
projected to rise, the unrealized gain position is expected to decline over the next couple 
of years before turning into an unrealized loss position by ear ly-2023.  The position 
bottoms out at an unrealized loss of around $85 billion in 2026 :Q2.  Compared with the 
July Tealbook, the path for the unr ealized position of the SOMA  portfolio is moderately 
higher over the next several year s reflecting the lower path for longer-term interest rates. 
Total term premium effect .  As shown in the table “Projections for the 10-Year 
Treasury Total Term Premium Eff ect (TTPE),” the securities held  in the SOMA portfolio 
are estimated to be reducing the  term premium embedded in the 1 0-year Treasury yield 
by about 130 basis points in the cur rent quarter, little change d from the July projections.11   
Over the projection horizon, the m agnitude of the downward pres sure exerted on 
the term premium in longer-term Treasury yields is estimated to  diminish gradually.  The 
gradual decline reflects both t he projected continued decrease in the size of the SOMA 
portfolio relative to nominal GDP through the third quarter of 2021 and the decrease in 
the duration of the Federal Res erve’s securities holdings for t he remainder of the 
projection horizon.  Over the next  decade, the average projected pace of decline in the 
TTPE is about 3 basis points pe r year.  At the end of 2030, the  total term premium effect 
of the SOMA portfolio on the 10-year Treasury yield is estimate d to be less than 
100 basis points.   
In the staff’s TTPE model, it is implicitly assumed that any ch ange in the 
weighted-average duration of the F ederal Reserve’s Treasury securities holdings results 
in a corresponding change (in th e opposite direction) in the weighted-average duration of 
Treasury securities held by the private sector.  The box titled  “Measuring the Combined 
Effects of the Federal Reserve’s  Asset Purchase Programs and Tr easury’s Debt 
Management” discusses the imp lications of alternative assumptio ns and provides 
historical estimates of the TTPE. 
                                                 
10 See the Tealbook B box titled “W hat Does It Mean for the SOMA Portfolio to Be in an 
‘Unrealized Loss’ Position?” (Jun e 2018) for an explanation of the accounting concepts underlying  
unrealized and realized gain an d loss positions, as well as the ir implications for the Federal Reserve’s 
ability to meet its obligations. 
11 The overall 10-year Treasury term  premium is assumed to gradua lly approach its long-run value 
of 88 basis points.

  Measuring  the Combined  Effects of the Federal Reserve’s  
Asset Purchase  Programs  and Treasury’s  Debt Management   
The Total  Term Premium  Effect (TTPE)  measures  the estimated  effect on the 10‐year 
Treasury term premium  of reducing  by private investors’  Treasury  and MBS portfolios  
by the amount of securities  held in the SOMA.1  Previous  staff work has interpreted  
changes in the TTPE  as a measure  of accommodation  added or  withdrawn  through 
balance sheet  policies.  This interpretation  rests on the assumption  that the Treasury  
does not respond to changes  in SOMA securities  holdings  by adjusting  either the 
amount or the weighted  average maturity  (WAM) of total debt outstanding.   In 
practice, 
however,  as shown in  Figure 1, the Treasury  has allowed the maturity  
composition  of outstanding  debt to change  over time,  and it is possible that following  
the crisis the Treasury’s debt  management  decisions  were affected  by the FOMC’s 
balance sheet  policies.2  This box explores  how assessments  of the degree of 
accommodation  provided  through balance sheet policies  would be altered by 
endogenous  responses  of the Treasury. 
During the initial phase of  the Great Recession,  the Treasury  met increased  financing  
needs with short‐term  issuance,  which decreased  the WAM of the portfolio to  a  
multi‐decade low in 2008.  Treasury  debt management  practices  subsequently  
reversed,  and the WAM increased 
to above pre‐crisis levels.  This reversal coincided  
with the period in which the Federal Reserve  conducted  the asset purchase programs.   
By altering the maturing  composition  of outstanding  debt held by private investors,  
Treasury debt management  practices, si milarly to  asset purchase programs,  affect 
term premiums embedded  in longer‐term Treasury  yields.   
                                                 
1 The methodology  underlying  the calculation  of the TTPE is explained  in the Balance Sheet and 
Income Projections  section of the March 2019 Tealbook  B.   
2 Alternatively,  the Treasury’s  maturity  extension  may have reflected  longstanding  Treasury 
practices  consistent  with past behavior in which there were substantial  increases  in Treasury 
borrowing.  For  example,  in the 1980s, as the debt‐to‐GDP ratio rose  by about  20 percentage  points, 
the Treasury increased  the WAM of outstanding  debt by about 2 years.

The solid lines in Figure 2 show the TTPEs following  major announcements  of the asset 
purchase  programs.3  The staff’s TTPE projections  provide an indication  of how the 
Federal Reserve’s total  securities  holdings affect  private‐sector holdings and thus 
term premiums,  keeping all other factors constant,  including  Treasury’s  debt 
management  practices.   However,  Greenwood,  Hanson, Rudolph,  and Summers  
(2014) found that, as a result of the changes in the maturity distrib ution of Treas ury 
debt issuance,  private‐sector holdings of longer‐term securities  were increased  by an 
amount that offset about one‐third of the reduction  in term premiums  resulting from 
the Federal Reserve's  asset purchases  of 2009‐2014.4   
The dashed lines in Figure 2 show the combined  effects on the term premium  of the 
Federal Reserve’s balance  sheet policy announcements  and the Treasury’s  decisions  
regarding  the maturity of debt issuance.   In line with  the estimates  by Greenwood  et 
al. (2014), the projections  that include the  combined  effects are associated  with  term 
premium  effects
 that  are, on average, one‐third smaller  than those of monetary  policy 
alone.5 
                                                 
3 In constructing  projections  for the asset purchase  programs,  we used the methodology  from 
Jane  Ihrig,  Elizabeth  Klee, Canlin Li, Min Wei, and Joe Kachovec  (2018), "Expectations  About the 
Federal  Reserve’s  Balance Sheet and the Term Structure  of Interest  Rates,"  International  Journal of 
Central Banking 14, no. 2: 341‐391.  
4 See Robin Greenwood,  Samuel G. Hanson, Joshua S. Rudolph,  and Lawrence  H. Summers  
(2014), “Government  Debt Management  at the Zero Lower Bound,”  Working Paper no.5, Hutchins 
Center on Fiscal and Monetary  Policy at Brookings.   
5 The projections  of the combined  effects  are subject to a great deal of uncertainty,  as both the 
magnitude  and the speed of Treasury’s  offset of the asset purchase  programs’  effects  on the term 
premium  are highly uncertain.

As shown by the solid black line in Figure 2, the announcement  of LSAP  1 and its 
subsequent  extension are  estimated  to have initially reduced 10‐year Treasury yields 
by about 60 basis points, abstracting  from any change in the Treasury’s  debt 
management  practices.   In comparison  with  the solid black line, the dashed black line 
indicates  that the estimated  combined  effects are, on average, about 10 basis points 
less negative over the
 whole projection.  
As shown by the solid blue line, the cumulative  effects of LSAPs 1 and 2, the MEP, and 
continued  reinvestments  are estimated  to have further  expanded  the term premium 
effect to about  negative 90 basis points.  The dashed blue line shows that the 
cumulative  effects of the Treasury’s decision  to 
lengthen  the maturity of its debt 
widens the difference  in magnitudes  between  the TTPE projection  and the projection  
with  the combined  effect.  The dashed red line, which  captures the combined  effects 
of LSAP  3, continued  reinv estments, and Treasury’s
 debt management,  shows a 
similar pattern relative to the solid red line representing  the baseline TTPE projection.  
In a future recession  during which the  federal funds  rate  may be constrained  by the 
ELB and the Committee  decides to undertake  asset  purchases,  Treasury may again 
increase the maturity of its debt issuance.   In such  circumstances,  the Committee  may 
need to take the Treasury’s actions  into account when determining  the size and 
composition  of a future asset purchase  program.
  By reducing term premiums,  asset 
purchases  by the Federal Reserve may make it relatively  more attractive  for the 
Treasury to issue longer‐term securities  and lower  debt‐service costs,
 which would  
partially offset the effects of the Federal  Reserve’s  actions.   However, the  Treasury 
Borrowing  Advisory Committee  has suggested  that, in a future ELB episode, the 
Treasury might also want to give consideration  to actions that would,  instead, shorten 
the WAM of its outstandin g debt, as such
 moves might help support  economic  
activity.
