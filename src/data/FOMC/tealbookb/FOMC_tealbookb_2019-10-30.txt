Monetary Policy Alternatives 
The three alternative policy state ments presented below offer a range of options 
for the setting of the current s tance of monetary policy and fo r communicating the likely 
near-term path of policy.  All th ree alternatives have similar characterizations of the 
incoming data as well as the ec onomic outlook, but the latter c haracterization is 
conditioned on the different polic y assumption associated with each alternative. 
Alternative B reduces the target range for the federal funds ra te by ¼ percentage 
point, and it offers the same ra tionale for the policy action—t he implications of global 
developments as well as muted i nflation pressures— as that in th e FOMC’s September 
postmeeting statement.  Alternative B replaces the “act as appr opriate” language that has 
appeared in recent postmeeting statements with language indicat ing that the Committee 
“will continue to monitor the implications of incoming informat ion for the economic 
outlook as it assesses the appropriate path of the target range  for the federal funds rate.”  
This change in language is meant to convey a diminished likelih ood of additional 
reductions in the target range, consistent with a view that, af ter the policy action at this 
meeting, the Committee has, over the course of the year, provid ed significant 
accommodation to support a favorable economic outlook. 
Alternative A also reduces the target range for t he federal funds rate by 
¼ percentage point.  Alternative A emphasizes that inflation has run persistently below 
2 percent and cites this persistent undershooti ng in its ration ale for the policy action.  
Unlike Alternative B, Alternativ e A maintains the “act as appro priate” language, which 
signals a greater openness to addi tional reductions in the targ et range for the federal funds 
rate. 
Alternative C maintains the current target range for the federa l funds rate.  It notes 
that the unemployment rate decl ined in September and expresses the view that the current 
stance of policy is consistent w ith sustained expansion of econ omic activity, strong labor 
market conditions, and inflation ne ar the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective.  
Alternative C removes the refe rence to global developments and muted inflation 
pressures that have been cited as reasons for recent policy act ions.  As in Alternative B, 
Alternative C replaces the “act  as appropriate” language to sig nal that future declines in 
the target range for the federal funds rate are less likely.

With regard to the specifics of the language in Alternatives A,  B, and C: 
The assessment of the incoming data:
oThe three alternatives have similar descriptions of the incomin g data with
respect to the labor market and economic activity.  In particul ar, all three
continue to describe economic growth as “moderate,” characteriz e the labor
market and growth of household spending as “strong,” and note that business
fixed investment and exports “have  remained weak.”  While all o f the
alternatives say that average job gains in recen t months have b een “solid,”
Alternatives A and B describe the unemployment rate as remainin g low,
whereas Alternative C notes that the unemployment rate “decline d.”
oAlternatives B and C note that c ore and headline inflation rate s “are running
below 2 percent,” while Alternativ e A states that these measure s “continue to
run below 2 percent.”  With regar d to inflation expectations, a ll three
alternatives continue to say that market-based measures of inflation
compensation “remain low” and that survey-based measures of lon ger-term
inflation expectations are “little changed.”
The outlook for economic activit y, the labor market, and inflat ion is the same across
all three altern atives and is unchanged from the September FOMC  statement, but the
alternatives condition on di fferent policy assumptions.
The current policy decision a nd the outlook for policy:
oAlternatives A and B lower the target range for the federal fun ds rate by
¼ percentage point.  As in the Sep tember postmeeting statement,
Alternative B cites global deve lopments and muted inflation pressures as
reasons for this action.  Alternative A cites inflation “runnin g persistently
below 2 percent” in its rationa le for the polic y action.  Alter native C leaves
the target range unchanged and removes the reference to global developmentsand muted inflation pressures.
oRegarding the outlook for policy, A lternatives B and C replace the “act as
appropriate” language with the statement that the Committee “wi ll continue to
monitor the implications of incom ing information for the econom ic outlook as
it assesses the appropriate path of  the target range for the fe deral funds rate.”
Alternative A retains the “act  as appropriate” language.

 SEPTEMBER 2019  FOMC  STATEMENT  
1. Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in July 
indicates that the labor marke t remains strong and that economi c activity has been 
rising at a moderate rate.  J ob gains have been solid, on avera ge, in recent months, 
and the unemployment rate has  remained low.  Although household  spending has 
been rising at a strong pace, business fixed investment and exp orts have 
weakened.  On a 12-month basis, ov erall inflation and inflation  for items other 
than food and energy are running below 2 percent.  Market-based  measures of 
inflation compensation remain low ; survey-based measures of lon ger-term 
inflation expectations are little changed. 
 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum 
employment and price stability.  I n light of the implications o f global 
developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflatio n pressures, the 
Committee decided to lower the tar get range for the federal fun ds rate to 1-3/4 to 
2 percent.  This action supports the Committee’s view that sust ained expansion of 
economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the 
Committee’s symmetric 2 percent ob jective are the most likely o utcomes, but 
uncertainties about this outlook remain.  As the Committee contemplates the 
future path of the target range  for the federal funds rate, it will continue to 
monitor the implications of incom ing information for the econom ic outlook and 
will act as appropriate to sustain  the expansion, with a strong  labor market and 
inflation near its symme tric 2 percent objective. 
 
3. In determining the timing and size  of future adjustments to the  target range for the 
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expe cted economic 
conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 
2 percent inflation objective.  This assessment will take into account a wide range 
of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of 
inflation pressures and inflati on expectations, and readings on  financial and 
international developments.

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OUTLOOK  
•The staff projects that  real GDP growth will slow from about 2.6 percent in the first 
half of 2019 to about 1.6 percent in the second half.  The projection for real GDP 
growth over the short term and the medium term is almost unchanged from the 
September Tealbook.
oData through September suggest that spending by the household sector  
continues to grow at a healthy clip in the second half of this year.  Data o n 
auto sales and retail sales sugg est continued strength in consumption 
spending, while recent data on housing permits and home sales point to a  
turn-up in residential investment spending.  Moreover, consumer sentiment 
remains positive.
oTrade tensions and global growth prospects continue to weigh on 
manufacturing, business fixed investmen
t, and exports.  In September, ISM 
indexes for manufacturing production and new exports orders  reached the 
lowest levels recorded in the past decade.
oGovernment purchases, which have contributed to the strength in aggregate 
demand this year, are projected to wane next year.
•Available data indicate that the labor market continued to stre
ngthen, but job gains 
have slowed from last year’s pace.  The staff expects no further tightening in the labor 
market over the medium term.
oCurrently published dat
a indicate that private nonfarm payroll gains averaged  
156,000 jobs per month in the first half of the year and slowed to 119,000 in 
the third
 quarter.  Job openings have declined somewhat fro m recent highs, 
while initial claims for unemployment insurance have remained low.
oThe unemployment rate fell to 3.5 percent in September, and the staff projects
 
the unemployment rate to remain near this level for the remainder of the year. 
The lab
or force participation rate held steady at around 63 percent, and it is 
little changed since 2013 even though demographic changes imply a 
downw ard trend in participation over this p eriod.
oAverage hourly earnings rose 2.9 percent over the 12 mon ths ending in  
September, which is somewhat below the pace of roughly 3.2 percent seen in 
recent months.
•Inflation remains subdued, despite the sustained low levels of the unemployment rate.

oThe staff estimates that core PCE prices incr eased 1.7 percent over the
12 months ending in September and that this measure of inflation will remain  
at this level through the end of the year.  The staff projects that by the end of 
the first quarter of next year, cor
e PCE price inflation will pi ck up to
2.0 percent as the low readings fr om earlier this year, which are seen as the 
result of idiosyncratic and temporary factors, drop out of the 12-month 
calculation.  Thereafter, the staf f expects core PCE price inflation to fall to 1.8 
percent over the medium term, as the fading effects of the recent tariff  
increases and a rising dollar offset upward inflation pressure from high levels  
of resource utilization.
oThe staff projects that energy prices will continue to fall through next year, 
and, as a result, that total PCE price inflation will run below core PCE price 
inflation during that period.
oConsistent with no further tightening in the 
labor market, the staff projects 
continued moderate wage g
rowth over the medium term.
oMeasu res of longer-term inflation expectations from the Michigan survey and  
the FRBNY Survey of Consumer Expectations edged down since September. 
Market-based measures of inflation
 compensation declined somewhat, and 
they are
 at or near multi-year lows. 
Financial market developments  over the early part of the interm eeting period were
primarily driven by weaker-than-ex pected data releases, in particular, the ISM
manufacturing and non-manufacturing surveys.1  Later in the period, increased
optimism regarding trade negotia tions between the United States  and China
contributed to a partial re bound in market sentiment.
oSince the September FOMC meetin g, Treasury yields have posted m odest
declines, with larger movements at the short end of the yield curve.
oOn net, broad equity indexes are  little changed over the interm eeting period.
oEstimates from statistical models  that rely solely on the term spread to give
the probability that a recession w ill occur within the next 12 months have
come down but remain elevated.  O ther models that include addit ional

target range for the federal fu nds rate at the October FOMC meeting.

   Monetary  Policy Expectations  and Uncertainty  
Expectations  for the near ‐term path of the federal funds  rate moved  down over the  
intermeeting  period, predominantly  in response  to weaker‐than ‐expected  domestic 
data releases.  Financial  market prices, as  well as results from the Desk’s October 
surveys, currently  suggest a high likelihood  of a 25‐ basis‐point reduction in  the target 
range
 for the  federal funds  rate at the Committee’s  October meeting.   Meanwhile,  
expectations  for the path  of the policy rate beyond  mid‐ 2020 were little changed, on 
net. 
Figure 1 shows that, over the  intermeeting  period, the probability  distribution  for the 
level of the federal funds rate following  the upcoming  October meeting,  based on 
options quotes and assuming  zero term premiums,  shifted toward lower outcomes,  
and it 
now points to a 25‐ basis‐point reduction in  the target range as  the most likely 
outcome.   The distribution  currently  attaches  the same probability,  only about 15 
percent, to the target range  for the federal  funds rate being  left unchanged  and to a 
50‐basis‐poin t reduction
 in the target range.   The corresponding  probability  
distribution  from the October Desk  surveys (not  shown) suggests  comparable odds,  
with survey  respondents  assigning  on average 77 percent  probability  to a 25‐ basis‐
point reduction in  the target range,  20 percent probability  to no change, and 
3 percent  to a 50‐basis poin t reduction.   Over
 the intermeeting  period, the market‐
implied probability  of one or more 25‐basis‐point rate cuts  at the October meeting  
(the blue line in figure 2) increased  notably, in response  to weaker‐ than‐expected  
domestic  data 
releases.  The estimated  probability  of a rate decline  now stands at a 
level similar to that  prevailing  just before the July and September  FOMC meetings  (the 
dark and orange lines, respectively).  
As shown in  Figure 3, the option‐implied probability  distribution  of the federal funds  
rate for  the end of 2019  also shifted toward lower values  over the  intermeeting  
period.  The distribution  now assigns roughly equal odds to the  federal funds  rate 
falling into either the 1.25 to 1.5 percent  range or the 1.5 to 1.75 percent range, 
suggesting  similar probabilities  for a total  of either one or two 25‐ basis‐point rate cuts  
through the remainder of  this year.  In contrast,  the shift 
to the left of the 
corresponding  year‐ end probability  distribution  from the October  Desk surveys was 
less noticeable (figure 4).  This  distribution  continues  to suggest  that investors  place 
the greatest  odds on the federal  funds rate falling  into the 1.5 to 1. 75 percent range.  
The
 differences  between the  market‐implied and survey‐implied distributions  likely 
reflect, in part, negative  risk premiums  embedded in  the options quotes. 
As shown in  the blue lines in figure 5, with regard  to the period  beyond mid‐ 2020 the 
expected  federal funds  rate path implied  by OIS quot es  has changed  little, on net, 
since the September FOMC  meeting.   Under the  assumption  of zero term  premiums,  
these market ‐implied forward rates suggest that investors  expect the federal funds  
rate to fall about  35 basis points by end‐2019 relative to the midpoint  of the current

target range,  to decline  an additional  28 basis point by end‐2020, and  to remain  flat 
thereafter.   In contrast,  the latest path from  a staff term structure  model that  adjusts 
for term premiums (the  purple lines) suggests  a shorter  easing cycle, with the federal 
funds rate expected  to decline  26 basis points  by end‐2019, before  rising around 20 
basis points in both 2020 and 2021.  The
 expected  federal funds  rate path implied  by 
an alternative  macro‐ finance model (not  shown) lies closer to the unadjusted  forward 
rate path and  suggests  a reduction  in the federal funds  rate of 30 basis points by end‐
2019 and an additional  17 basis points by end‐2020. 
Results from the Desk’s October Surveys 
of Primary Dealers and Market Participants  
offered somewhat  differing  perspectives  on the expected  federal funds  rate path.   
The modal  path for the federal funds  rate reported  by the median respondent to  the 
Survey of Primary Dealers (the open red  circles in 
figure 5) points to expectations  for a 
25‐basis‐point decline in the target range  by year‐ end 2019 and an additional  25‐basis‐
point cut in the first quarter of 2020.  In contrast,  the implied modal path  from the 
Survey of Market Participants  (the  black crosses), although  similarly suggesting  a 25‐
basis‐point decline in  the target range by  year‐ end, has a flat path  thereafter.

Figure 6 shows that the median probability  of moving to the zero lower bound (ZLB) 
over the next three years  edged up in the October surveys  to about  40 percent,  
suggesting  that investors  continue  to perceive  the risks to the  outlook to be skewed 
towards the downside.  In  contrast,  market‐based measures  of the probability   of 
moving below the ZLB—estimated  from options on Eurodollar  futures and without 
adjusting  for risk premiums—were  little changed, on  net, over the  intermeeting  
period.  In particular,  the option‐implied probability  of the three‐month LIBOR being 
negative in two years ticked up early in the intermeeting  period before retracing  to a 
current level  of around 7 percent (figure  7).  
Similarly,  the probability  that the three‐
month LIBOR will end up below 25 and 50 basis points in two years’  time (not shown) 
was little changed, on  net, at about 9 and 14 percent,  respectively.1  Of note, the 
median probability  of the U.S. economy  first entering  a recession over  the next three 
years was unchanged  in the October  Desk surveys from the September  surveys, with 
respondents  assigning  on average 30 percent,  26 percent,  and 15 percent probability  
to the onset of a recession in  2020,  2021, and 2022, respectively. 
Figure 8 shows measures  of the longer‐run expected  federal funds  rate.  A straight  
read of forward rates  implied by 
Treasury yields suggests  that investors’  current 
expectation for  the average federal funds  rate 5 to 10 years  ahead (the blue line) was 
about unchanged  over the  intermeeting  period, and that it stands at 1.9 percent.   
Adjusting  for term premiums using  various staff term 
structure  models (with the  light‐
red‐shaded region showing  a range of  three such model estimates)  suggests  that 5‐to‐
10‐year‐ ahead expectations  remain above the unadjusted  forward rates, at between 
2.7 and 2.8 percent,  consistent  with a nega tive  term premium  at those horizons.   
Similarly,  the median longer ‐run forecast  from the Desk’s October surveys  (the green 
diamonds)  lies above the unadjusted  forward rates  and stands at 2.5 percent,  fairly 
close to the  model‐ based projections  for the federal  funds rate. 
1 The average spread between  three‐month LIBOR and three‐month  OIS rates has been about 
25 basis points on average in 2019 thus far, but it has fluctuated  between  14 and 40 basis points.  
Looking further back,  this spread was larger during the 2008 financial crisis, in part due to the credit 
risk embedde
d in LIBOR, and was on average about 100 basis points between  December  2007 and 
June 2009.

 The staff projects annualized a ggregate foreign growth in the s econd half of this year 
to be 1.8 percent, modestly weaker t han projected in the Septem ber Tealbook and

to global developments—along wit h the potential for adverse rea ctions in financial 
markets to these risks—could have  significant ne gative effects on U.S. economic 
activity beyond those already incor porated into the staff outlo ok.  Additionally, 
disappointing data on business fixe d investment and manufacturi ng production may 
be indicative of a more substant ial slowing of economic activit y than currently

THE CASE FOR ALTERNAT IVE B 
At the past two FOMC meetings, po licymakers cited the implicati ons of global 
developments for the U.S. economic outlook and muted inflation pressures as reasons for 
reducing the target range for t
he federal funds rate.  With no indication that undue 
inflation pressures are buildi ng, continued weakness in certain sectors, and ongoing 
uncertainties related to trade policy and global developm ents, policymakers may 
determine that another modest eas ing in the stance of m onetary policy is appropriate at 
this meeting. 
Economic activity ex
panded at a solid pace during the first half of this year, but at 
present the expansion is mainly driven by strong household spending and by fiscal 
impetus that is expected to wane over the next year.  Policymakers might note that 
uncertainty and global developments have already taken a toll on business fixed 
investment and exports, and that incoming information over the intermeeting period 
seems to indicate that these sectors will r
emain weak in the second half of the year.  At 
th
e same time, they may judge that data on auto sales, housing permits, and home sales 
are evidence that the policy accommodation that the FOMC has already provided this 
year is starting to stimulate aggregate demand.  Although policymakers may see 
continued eco
nomic expansion as the most likely outcome over coming quarters, they 
may judge that an 
additional, modest easing in the stance of policy  is appropriate to help 
sustain economic g rowth in the face of continued headwinds from global developments. 
Policymakers m
ay see inflation rising to 2 percent over time as the most likely 
outcome and discern no unwelcome upward pressure on price infla tion.  They may note 
that, despite ongoing strength in the labor market, nom inal wag e growth remains 
moderate.  Alternatively, they may regard the response of infla tion to resource utilization 
as too sma
ll to be of concern.  The se muted inflation pressures along with recen t low 
readings on longer-term inflati on expectations m ay lead policym akers to conclude that 
additional policy accommodation i s appropriate to support th e timely, sustained return of 
inflatio
n to 2 percent. 
However, before determining any further adjustments to the target range for the 
federal funds rate, and barring si
gnificant new adverse develop ments, the Committee may 
see it as advantageous to take some tim
e to assess the economic effects of its previous 
policy actions.  In addition to shifting its policy stance dire ctly through three 25 basis 
point cuts in the policy rate, the Comm ittee has used changes in communi cations to 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

 contribute to substant ial declines in mort gage rates and longer-term Treasury yields since 
the beginning of the year.  The f ull responses of economic acti vity to these lower interest 
rates may take some time to show up in incoming data.  Reflecti ng this situation, 
Alternative B would remove the “ act as appropriate” language to  convey that the 
Committee sees a lower probability of additional rate cuts in t he near term.  
When considering the risks t o the economic outlook, policymaker s may observe 
that several staff models suggest that the probability of reces sion within a year is 
somewhat lower than was the case in September, though these pro babilities remain 
elevated.  Policymakers may judge that the stance of policy is reasonably well-calibrated 
at present in light of the asy mmetry in the risks caused by the  effective lower bound:  
Should the risks abate, and econom ic activity and inflation turn out to be stronger than 
expected, the Committee would be  able to respond with increases  in the policy rate, 
whereas the converse is less likely to be true. 
Should policymakers choose the po licy action in Alternative B, financial market 
responses to this decision woul d likely be relatively modest.  Market prices, along with 
responses to the Desk’s latest surveys of primary dealers and m arket participants, 
currently indicate that a reduction in the target range by 25 b asis points at the October 
meeting is widely viewed as the most likely outcome.  Many mark et participants will 
likely interpret the removal of t he “act as appropriate” language as an indication that the 
Committee is less likely to provi de additional accommodation th an currently perceived, 
in which case expectations for  the path of short-term interest rates would likely move up 
and inflation compensation could edge down.  Additionally, long er-term Treasury yields 
may rise modestly and equity prices could decline.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNAT IVE C
Policymakers may see incoming data as continuing to indicate that the economy is 
operating above its potential leve l and that the labor market i s tightening further.  They 
may also judge that weak inflati on readings earlier in the year were the  result of 
transitory factors , and that inflation i s likely to m
ove to 2 p ercent next year.  At the same 
time, in ligh
t of recent weakness in business fixed investment and exports, they may 
judge that uncertainties to the econom ic outlook rem ain and pre fer to maintain the current 
target range for the federal f unds rate as they assess incoming inform ation. 
Policymakers m
ay observe that, although certain sectors have di splayed some  
weakness, household spending remains strong and the labor market has tightened further.  
They might also note that, while some of the recession-probability models reported by 
the 
staff and others show an elevated likelihood of a recession  in the next 12 months, that 
inference may be fragile, as alternative models, which include either the excess bond 
premium or nonfinancial variab les, do not show particularly hig h recession probabilities. 
Policymakers m
ay view current financial conditions as highly ac commodative, 
noting the approximately 1 percenta ge point decline in the 10-y ear Treasury yield since 
the start of the year.  They may a rgue that the full effect of that easing will take time to 
show through to expenditures.  A
dditionally, policymakers may view monetary policy 
actions and associated communicat ions as important determinants of financial conditions, 
irrespective of macro econom
ic fundamentals, and be concerned ab out perceptions of 
market expectations of monetar y policy influencing policy itsel f.  As a result, they may 
choose to maintain the current t
arget range for the federal fun ds rate and dis courage the 
impression that the provision of further policy accommodation i s likely in the near term. 
Policymakers may observe that the factors that caused the softn ess in inflation 
readings earlier in the year were transito
ry, as expected.  The y m ay also note that the 
decline in the unemployment rate, together with the lagged effe cts of the accommodation 
that they have already provi
ded, should support stronger nominal wage growth—a 
development that will be helpful in raising inflation. 
In addition, policymakers may regard persistently low interest rates as 
exacerbating
 vulnerabilities to financial stability.  For example, they may stress that 
prices in equity and bond markets are near historical peaks, while valuation pressures in 
leveraged loan and commercial re
al estate markets remain high.  Additionally, they may 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

 see borrowing by non-financial busin esses as being historically  high, with the most rapid 
increases in debt concentrated a mong the riskiest firms.  As a result, they might judge 
that financial stability conside rations strengthen the case for  leaving the target range 
unchanged. 
The policy action in Alternative C would be i nconsistent with t he widely-held 
market expectation of a reduction in the target range for the f ederal funds rate at the 
upcoming meeting.  In combination with the removal of the “act as appropriate” 
language, Alternative C would lik ely result in a significant re pricing in financial markets.  
Market expectations for the pat h of short-term interest rates w ould probably shift up.  
Equity prices and inflation compe nsation would likely fall.  Al though policymakers may 
view some revisions to market e xpectations as warranted, the ap parent inconsistency of 
Alternative C with recent Federa l Reserve communications could well cause confusion 
among investors about the Committee’s intentions.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Policymakers may be particularl y concerned about the ongoing we akness in 
inflation and inflation expecta tions, or view risks to the econ omic outlook as significantly 
weighted to the downside.  If s o, they may deem it appropriate to signal their heightened 
concern and their willingness t o provide a greater degree of mo netary policy 
accommodation than would be the case under Alternative B.  With  Alternative A, 
policymakers would communicate that they decided to lower the t arget range for the 
federal funds rate in light of “ the implications of global deve lopments for the economic 
outlook as well as inflation runni ng persistently below 2 perce nt.”  In contrast to 
Alternative B, policymakers may c hoose to retain the “act as ap propriate” language, 
thereby indicating greater openne ss to further near-term reduct ions in the target range for 
the federal funds rate. 
With inflation continuing to run pe rsistently below the Committ ee’s symmetric 
2 percent objective, several sur vey-based measures of inflation  expectations at or near the 
lower end of their historical ra nges, and market-based measures of inflation 
compensation near multi-year lows, policymakers may be concerne d that inflation 
expectations have already moved below levels consistent with th e Committee’s 2 percent 
objective.  They may therefore see significant risks that infla tion could fail to return to 
2 percent on a sustained basis unless the Committee signals its  willingness to provide 
further accommodation.  They mi ght also note that growth of lab or compensation appears 
to be muted, and they may judge t hat the string of underpredictions of the labor force 
participation rate by forecasters  over the past few years indic ates that the labor market 
has more room to run without i nducing an undue increase in inflation.  Policymakers 
might also argue that inflat ion running modestly above 2 percen t for a time is needed to 
re-center inflation expectat ions on the 2 percent objective.  T hey may see accomplishing 
this re-centering before the ne xt recession as particularly imp ortant because higher 
inflation expectations would be tter enable monetary policy to provide accommodation in 
the event that the Committee finds itself constrained by the ef fective lower bound. 
From a risk-management perspective, policymakers may judge that cutting the 
target range for the federal  funds rate while remaining open to  providing further policy 
accommodation in the future could help cushion the effects on t he economy of possible 
adverse shocks.  Policymakers ma y judge that, with many policy authorities around the 
world not well positioned to r espond to a slowdown in demand, t he global economy is in 
a fragile state and that unfavorable resolution of uncertaintie s facing the global economy 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

could weigh heavily on the U.S . economy.  They might also point to recession-
probability models that show elevated estimates of the likeliho od of a recession in the 
United States over the next 12 m onths.  Policymakers might judg e that, in light of the 
proximity of the policy rate to  its effective lower bound and t he possibility that the 
neutral interest rate is low er than they previously thought, th ey should signal their 
willingness to act vigorously when confronted with such risks. 
A statement such as Alternativ e A would likely be seen by marke t participants as 
implying a more accommodative path for the policy rate than had  been anticipated.  In 
particular, the language of “i nflation running persistently bel ow 2 percent,” would likely 
increase market expectations for  further reductions in the fede ral funds rate.  If market 
participants interpret Alternati ve A as expressing the Committee’s desire to provide 
additional accommodation so as to raise inflation to 2 percent or above, then equity prices 
and inflation compensation woul d likely rise.  However, in the less-likely event that 
market participants interprete d Alternative A as amounting to a  bleaker reading of the 
outlook for activity than they had been expecting, equity price s would likely fall.

Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation  
The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy 
stance announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its st atement on September 
18, 2019 October 30, 2019 : 
 The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted [ unanimously ] to 
lower the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances to 1.80 1.55 
percent, effective September 19, 2019 October 31, 2019 . Setting the interest rate 
paid on required and excess rese rve balances 20 basis points be low the top of the 
target range for the federal funds rate is intended to foster trading in the federal 
funds market at rates well within the FOMC's target range. 
 As part of its policy decision, the F ederal Open Market Committee voted to 
authorize and direct the Open Mar ket Desk at the Federal Reserv e Bank of New 
York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in th e System Open Market 
Account in accordance with the f ollowing domestic policy direct ive: 
“Effective October 15, 2019 October 31, 2019 , the Federal Open Market 
Committee directs the Desk to unde rtake open market operations as necessary to 
maintain the federal funds r ate in a target range of 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 to 2 percent.  In 
light of recent and expected incr eases in the Federal Reserve’s  non-reserve 
liabilities, the Comm ittee directs the Desk to purchase Treasur y bills at least into 
the second quarter of next year t o maintain over time ample res erve balances at or 
above the level that prevaile d in early September 2019.  The Co mmittee also 
directs the Desk to conduct term and overnight repurchase agree ment operations 
at least through January of next  year to ensure that the supply  of reserves remains 
ample even during periods of sharp increases i n non-reserve lia bilities, and to 
mitigate the risk of money market pressures that could adversely affect policy 
implementation.  In addition, the Committee directs the Desk to  conduct 
overnight reverse repurchase ope rations (and reverse repurchase operations with 
maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conve ntions) at an offering rate of  1.70 1.45 percent, in 
amounts limited only by the value of  Treasury securities held o utright in the 
System Open Market Account that are available for such operatio ns and by a per-
counterparty limit of $30 billion per day.  
 
The Committee directs the Des k to continue rolli ng over at auct ion all principal 
payments from the Federal Rese rve’s holdings of Treasury securi ties and to 
continue reinvesting all principal payments from the Federal Re serve’s holdings 
of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities received d uring each

Balance Sheet and Income Projections 
The staff has prepared projecti ons of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the 
associated income statement that  are consistent with the projections in Tealbook A.1  The 
balance sheet projections are substantially changed from the September Tealbook.  The 
changes reflect revised assump tions about policy regarding the evolution of the SOMA 
portfolio and the minimum level  of reserve balances to ensure t hat the supply of reserves 
remains ample. 
To be consistent with the Committee’s Statement Regarding Monet ary Policy 
Implementation released on Octobe r 11, the current projections are based on an assumed 
minimum level of reserve bala nces of $1.46 trillion, the averag e level that prevailed in 
early September.  In the near term, this minimum level is achieved through a combination of Treasury bill purchases and r epo operations.  For the period  from May 2020 onward, 
we assume that reserve balances and the overall balance sheet will grow in line with nominal GDP. 
Our assumption that reserve bala nces grow from their current le vel, rather than 
from the previously assumed minimum value of $1 trillion, impli es that reserve balances 
and the SOMA portfolio begin grow ing about 1½ years earlier and  increase to a level 
about $750 billion above that in t he September Tealbook by the end of the projection.   
As a consequence, the balance sh eet remains close to its curren t share of 19 percent of 
nominal GDP, 3 percentage points higher than its long-run share  in the previous 
Tealbook (see the exhibit titled “Total Assets and Selected Bal ance Sheet Items”).   
While the higher assumed minimum level of reserves has importan t implications for the 
projected size and composition of t he balance sheet, the minimu m level of reserves 
consistent with remaining in an ample-reserves regime is uncert ain and will likely need to 
be reassessed as information accrues about banks’ demand for re serve balances.

Reserve balances.  Reserve balances at the start of the projection are about 
$310 billion higher than they were projected to be at this poin t in the September 
Tealbook.  This higher level larg ely reflects the amount of repo operations outstanding

 since September.  Through mid-April 2020, purchases of Treasury  bills and repo 
operations are assumed to keep reserves at or above $1.46 trill ion; these operations offset 
increases in currency and in the T reasury’s General Account (TG A) balance that would 
otherwise cause reserve balances  to fall below this level (see the upper chart in the 
exhibit titled “SOMA O pen Market Operations  and Their Near-Term Effect on Reserve 
Balances”).3  From May 2020 onward, reserves ar e projected to grow in line with 
nominal GDP.4  This assumption implies a level that is about $575 billion hi gher than 
was projected in the Septe mber Tealbook by 2021:Q3, which was t he date when reserves 
had declined to their assumed m inimum level of $1 trillion in t he previous projection. 
Evolution of the SOMA portfolio.  As of September 2019, the size of the SOMA 
portfolio was roughly $3.6 tri llion, consisting of about $2.1 t rillion of Treasury securities 
and $1.5 trillion of agency securiti es (see the exhibit titled “Federal Reserve Balance 
Sheet Month-end Projections—October Tealbook”).  Consistent wit h the Statement 
Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation, we assume that the De sk will purchase 
Treasury bills at a pace of $60 billion per month from mid-Octo ber to mid-April.5  
Thereafter, we assume that the SOMA portfolio continues expandi ng in order to 
accommodate trend increases in reserves and in other Federal Re serve liabilities at a pace 
that is roughly in line with nomi nal GDP growth (see the exhibit titled “Total Assets and 
Selected Balance Sheet Items”).6  As a result of these assumpti ons, the size of the balance 
sheet stays at its current lev el of 19 percent of nominal GDP t hrough the projection 
horizon, 3 percentage poin ts higher than in the previous Tealbo ok.7  
 The weighted-average duration of  the SOMA Treasury portfolio is  currently 
6¾ years.  As shown in the exhibit “Projections for the Charact eristics of SOMA 
                                                 
3 The projection incorporates the  staff’s near-ter m forecast for  TGA balances through April 2020. 
Thereafter, TGA balances are assu med to grow in line with nomin al GDP for the remainder of the 
projection horizon. 
4 We assume that liability items o ther than currency, reserves, and the TGA, such as the foreign

 Treasury Securities Holdings,” the path for duration diverges considerably from that in 
the September projection.  Dura tion is projected to decline to about 6 years by April 
2020, a faster decline than in the previous projection, as the share of bills increases to 
15 percent of the SOMA Treasury portfolio.  The decline in dura tion then decelerates, 
reflecting the slower pace of bill purchases.8  After 2021, the decline in duration is more 
gradual than previously project ed, reflecting the revised assum ption that reinvestments of 
principal payments from agenc y securities holdings into Treasur y securities will be 
spread across the maturity spectrum of outstanding Treasury securities for the entire 
projection period.9  All told, the portfolio attains its assumed longer-run compos ition, 
consisting of one-third Treas ury bills, in 2025:Q3, two quarter s earlier than in the 
September Tealbook. 
Principal payments from holdings  of agency securities are proje cted to exceed the 
$20 billion cap on reinvestment into Treasury securities in mos t months through the 
middle of 2020, and then fall belo w $20 billion as projected MB S prepayments decline 
(see the table and lower charts in the exhibit titled “SOMA Open Market Operations and 
Their Near-Term Effect  on Reserve Balances”).10  As agency MBS holdings and 
associated prepayments continue t o decline, reinvestments of ag ency securities into MBS 
are expected to cease in mid-2020.  The share of agency MBS in the SOMA portfolio, 
which currently stands at about  40 percent, is expected to decl ine to about 14 percent by 
the end of 2025, a smaller share th an in the September projection, due to the larger size of 
the Treasury portfolio.  
 Unrealized gains or losses. The SOMA portfolio was i n a net unrealized gain 
position of about $200 billion at the end of September (see the  exhibit titled “Income 
Projections”).  With longer-term in terest rates projected to ri se, the unrealized gain 
position is expected to decline ove r the next few years before turning into an unrealized 
loss position by early-2023.  The position bottoms out at an un realized loss of around 
                                                 
8 As the Committee has not yet reac hed a decision on the long-ru n composition of the SOMA 
portfolio, we continue to assume  that purchases aimed at accomm odating trend growth in Federal Reserve 
liabilities will be directed entirely towards Treasury bills un til bills constitute approximately one-third of 
the Federal Reserve’s portfolio  of Treasury securities, close to the pre-crisis com position.  Once that 
composition is reached, further purchases aimed at accommodatin g growth in Federal Reserve liabilities 
are assumed to reflect the proj ected maturity distribution of Treasury securities outstanding at that time. 
9 In previous projections, it was assumed that the maturity dist ribution of these reinvestments 
mirrored that of purchases aimed at accommodating growth in Fed eral Reserve liabilities (see footnote 8).  
10 The exhibit no longer presents information on Treasury securit y rollovers, due to the anticipated 
high rate of turnover of Treasur y bills in the SOMA portfolio.

$37 billion in 2025:Q3.  Compared w ith the September Tealbook, the path for the 
unrealized position of the SOMA po rtfolio is higher after 2022, ref lecting the lower pa th 
for longer-term interest rates.11 
Total Term Premium Ef
fect. As shown in the table “Proj ections for the 10-Year 
Treasury Total Term 
Premium Eff ect (TTPE),” the securities held in the S OMA portfolio 
are estimated to be reducing the
 term premium embedded in the 1 0-year Treasury yield 
by about 135 basis points in the c urrent quarter, 7 basis point s more than in the 
Septem
ber Tealbook.12  Over the projection horizon, the m agnitude of the downward 
pressure exerted on the term pre mium in longer-term Treasury yields is estimated to 
diminish gradually, at an ave rage pace of about 2.5 basis points per year.  The gradual 
decline reflects the decreas
e in the duration of the Federal Reserve’s securities holding s 
over the projection horizon.  A t the end of 2030, the total ter m premium effect of the 
SOMA portfolio on the 10-year Treasury yield is estimated to be about 110 basis points. 
Over the projection horizon, the SOMA portfolio is expected to exert a little m
ore 
downward pressure on Treasury term prem iums than was the case i n Septem ber.  
Although duration of the SOMA portf
olio is projected to be lower over the next few 
years than in the September Tealbook, the portfolio’s size is expected to be larger.  The 
greater magnitude of the TTPE al so reflects the assumption that reinvestm ents of 
principal payments from agenc y securities into Treasury securit ies will be spread across 
the m aturity spectrum of outstanding Treasury securities for th e entire projection period 
(see footnote 9).  All else equa
l, the longer duration of the s ecurities acquired from these 
reinvestments increases the downward pressure of the SOMA portf olio on term 
premiums.  
Remittances.
 Remittances to the Treasury are p rojected to decline to $54 bil lion 
this year fro
m $65 billion in 2018 (s ee the exhibit titled  “Income Projections”).  This 
reduction mainly reflects lower in terest incom
e resulting from the reduction in SOMA 
securities holdings through Sep temb
er 2019.  Total interest exp ense is projected to be 
11 See the Tealbook B box titled “W hat Does It Mean for the SOMA Portfolio to Be in an 
‘Unrealized Loss’ Position?” (Jun e 2018) for an explanation of the accounting concepts underlying 
unrealized and realized gain an d loss positions, as well as the ir implications for the Federal Reserve’s 
ability to meet its obligations.  In this projection, the lower  path for longer term int erest rates reflects a 
downward revision to the staff’s assumption for the long-run va lue of the term premium. 
12 The overall 10-year Treasury term  premium is assumed to gradua lly approach its long-run value 
of 50 basis points.

 $41 billion this year, sl ightly lower than in 2018.13  Remittances are expected to increase 
to $62 billion next year and then c ontinue rising.  The upward- sloping path of remittances 
reflects an increase in net interest income associated with a g rowing balance sheet, as 
yields on longer-term securities in the SOMA portfolio exceed the rate paid on reserve 
balances. 
The projected path for remittances is higher through 2024 than it was in the 
September Tealbook, largely reflect ing the increased size of th e SOMA portfolio.  After 
2024, this effect is more than offset by the downward revision to long-term Treasury 
yields; this downward revision r educes the interest rate paid on securities in the SOMA 
portfolio and causes remittances to fall below their value in t he previous projection. 
                                                 
13 We continue to assume that the FOMC will set a 25  basis point-wide target range for the federal 
funds rate throughout the projection period.  Consistent with t he FOMC’s September 2019 Implementation 
Note, we assume that the IOER w ill be set 20 basis points below  the top of the target range, and the 
offering rate on overnight RRPs will be set 5 basis points belo w the bottom of the range.
