Monetary Policy Alternatives 
  In light of the Committee’s r ecent policy actions, as well as  communications 
indicating that an adjustment at  this meeting is unlikely in th e absence of a material 
reassessment of the economic ou tlook, all three of the alternat ive policy statements 
presented below maintain the tar get range for the federal funds  rate at 1½ to 1¾ percent.  
However, the alternatives vary i n their communications about th e likely future path of 
monetary policy. 
Alternative B expresses the Committee’s judgment that, followin g the 
adjustments made at earlier mee tings, “the current stance of mo netary policy is 
appropriate to support sustained e xpansion of economic activity , strong labor market 
conditions, and inflation near the  Committee’s symmetric 2 perc ent objective.”  Despite 
this judgment, Alternative B emphasizes that the Committee will  continue to monitor the 
implications of incoming inform ation for the economic outlook, “including global 
developments and muted inflation p ressures.”  This latter addit ion signals that the 
downside risk factors that had been cited as reasons for the ea rlier policy easings still 
merit particular attention. 
Alternative A expresses less confidence than Alternative B that  the current stance 
is appropriate to achieve the Committee’s goals by putting grea ter emphasis on the risk of 
undesirably low inflation.  In part icular, it downgrades the as sessment of survey-based 
measures of longer-term inflati on expectations by noting that “ indicators of longer-term 
inflation expectations remain l ow.”  In addition, it highlights uncertainties about the 
outlook including “whether infla tion will remain below 2 percen t longer than expected.” 
Alternative C is written in the  spirit of prudent planning for future circumstances 
in which the FOMC may want to sig nal that a rate hike is immine nt.  However, as data 
since the October meeting—when the Committee lowered the target  range—have not 
prompted any material change i n the economic outlook, a depicti on of incoming data 
since that meeting would likely be  at variance with the intende d policy message of 
Alternative C.  Consequently, the draft stat ement for Alternati ve C simply omits the first 
paragraph. 
With regard to the specifics of the language in Alternatives A,  B, and C:

  The assessment of the incoming data: 
o Alternatives A and B share the s ame characterizations of much o f the 
incoming data on the labor market and economic activity.  In pa rticular, the 
two alternatives continue to desc ribe economic growth as “moder ate,” 
characterize the labor market as “strong,” and the unemployment rate as 
remaining “low.”  Both Alterna tives note that household spendin g “has been 
rising at a strong pace,” while business fixed investment and e xports “remain 
weak.” 
o In characterizing the incoming data on inflation,  Alternative B  notes that core 
and headline inflation rates “ar e running” below 2 percent, whi le 
Alternative A stresses that the se measures “continue to run” below 2 percent.  
Regarding indicators of inflation expectations, Alternative B c ontinues to say 
that market-based measures of inflation compensation “remain low” and that 
survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are “little 
changed,” while Alternative A  strikes out the corresponding sen tence and 
emphasizes, instead, that “indicators of longer-term inflation expectations 
remain low.”  
 The outlook for economic activity and inflation: 
o Under all three alte rnatives, the outlook f or economic activity  and inflation is 
unchanged from the October statement.  However, to achieve the outcomes of 
“sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, 
and inflation near the Committee’ s symmetric 2 percent objectiv e,” the 
alternatives anticipate potent ially different paths for the target range for the 
federal funds rate. 
o Alternatives B and C delete the l anguage indicating that “uncer tainties about 
this outlook remain.” 
 The current policy decision a nd the outlook for policy: 
o All three alternatives maintain t he current target range for th e federal funds 
rate.  
o Under Alternative B, the Committ ee judges that “the current sta nce of 
monetary policy is appropriate t o support” susta ined expansion of economic 
activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near th e Committee’s 
symmetric 2 percent objective.  T his draft statement also notes  that the

 Committee will continue to monitor the implications of the inco ming 
information for the economic ou tlook, with specific reference t o “global 
developments and muted inflation pressures.”  
o Alternative A links the outlook f or the policy rate predominantly to inflation.  
In particular, it highlights un certainties about the outlook including “whether 
inflation will remain below 2 pe rcent longer than expected.”  
o By contrast, Alternative C offe rs an illustrative formulation, applicable to 
circumstances in which “some r eduction in the degree of monetar y 
accommodation may soon become appropriate.”

 OCTOBER 2019  FOMC  STATEMENT  
1. Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in September 
indicates that the labor marke t remains strong and that economi c activity has been 
rising at a moderate rate.  J ob gains have been solid, on avera ge, in recent months, 
and the unemployment rate has  remained low.  Although household  spending has 
been rising at a strong pace, business fixed investment and exp orts remain weak.  
On a 12-month basis, overall infl ation and inflation for items other than food and 
energy are running below 2 percent.   Market-based measures of i nflation 
compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term i nflation 
expectations are little changed. 
 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum 
employment and price stability.  I n light of the implications o f global 
developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflatio n pressures, the 
Committee decided to lower the tar get range for the federal fun ds rate to 1-1/2 to 
1-3/4 percent.  This action supports the Committee’s view that sustained 
expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions,  and inflation near 
the Committee’s symmetric 2 percen t objective are the most like ly outcomes, but 
uncertainties about this outlook remain.  The Committee will continue to monitor 
the implications of incoming information for the economic outlo ok as it assesses 
the appropriate path of the targe t range for the federal funds rate. 
 
3. In determining the timing and size  of future adjustments to the  target range for the 
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expe cted economic 
conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its  symmetric 2 
percent inflation objective.  Thi s assessment will take into account a wide range 
of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of 
inflation pressures and inflati on expectations, and readings on  financial and 
international developments.

 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OUTLOOK  
 The data released during the in termeeting period continue to suggest that economic 
activity has been expanding at a moderate rate in the second half of this year.  The 
staff projection for real GDP gr owth over the short and medium term is a touch 
stronger than in the October Teal book, largely reflecting a hig her projected path for 
equity prices. 
o Household spending rose at a s trong clip through the third quarter, buoyed by 
solid job gains and income grow th.  Recent data suggest some deceleration in 
spending this quarter.  Consumer sentiment remains positive. 
o After increasing at an annual rate of just 1.7 percent in the f irst half of this 
year, business fixed investment i s projected to decline about 1 .2 percent in the 
second half and to edge down a bit further in the first quarter  of 2020. 
o Net exports are expected to be a slight drag for U.S. GDP growt h in the 
second half of this year.  Aft er flattening out in the third qu arter, exports are 
projected to resume their d ecline in this quarter.   
 Available data indicate that t he labor market remains strong.  Although the pace of 
payroll growth has softened thi s year, it continues to exceed the pace consistent with 
no change in resource utilization. 
o Currently published data indi cate that, after rising 223,000 per month in 2018, 
nonfarm payroll employment ros e at an average monthly pace of n early 
167,000 this year through October.  The staff estimates that th e BLS 
benchmark revision early next year will lower total payroll emp loyment 
growth by 42,000 per month from the second quarter of 2018 through the first 
quarter of this year, and it will reduce estimates of payroll g rowth by 16,000 
per month through the rem ainder of this year. 
o The unemployment rate, which has hovered near 50-year lows for over a year, stood at 3.6 percent in October.  With projected output growth a bit above 
potential in 2020, the staff expect s the unemployment rate to t ick down to 
3.5 percent by the middle of next ye ar and to remain there thro ugh the end of 
2022. 
o The labor force participation r ate (LFPR) moved up further, to 63.3 percent, in 
October and has risen 0.5 percen tage point so far this year.  I n response to a

 string of unexpectedly strong LFPR r eadings, the staff revised up its estimate 
of the trend level of partic ipation in 2019 and over the projec tion period. 
o After a low reading in Septemb er, growth in average hourly earn ings in 
October was a little stronger, but its 12-month change has edge d down, on net, 
over the course of this year. 
 Inflation remains subdued, despit e the sustained low levels of the unemployment rate. 
o Core PCE prices increased 1.6 per cent over the 12 months ending  in October.  
Staff projects that this measure of inflation will run close to  this level through 
the end of the year and the n move up to 1.9 percent by March 20 20.  
Thereafter, the staff expects co re PCE price inflation to remai n at this level, a 
touch higher than in the previous forecast.  Over the medium te rm, core 
inflation runs a bit higher than the staff’s estimate of its un derlying trend of 
1.8 percent as the projected boost to inflation from tight resource utilization 
outweighs the downward pressure o n inflation arising from the i nfluence of 
the rising exchange value of t he dollar on import prices.  
o The staff projects that energy pr ices will continue to fall thr ough next year, 
and that, as a result, total PCE price inflation will run below  core PCE price 
inflation over that period.  
o Consistent with the absence of a  material tightening in the labor market over 
the forecast period, the staff anticipates continued moderate wage growth over 
the medium term. 
o The median of long-run inflation expectations from the Michigan  survey rose 
0.2 percentage point, to 2.5 percen t, in November.  The Federal  Reserve Bank 
of New York Survey of Consumer Expectations measure of median t hree-
year-ahead expected inflation was  unchanged in October at its h istorical low .  
Market-based measures of inflation compensation moved modestly higher 
since the time of the October meeting. 
 Sentiment in financial markets continued to fluctuate.1

   Monetary  Policy Expectations  and Uncertainty  
Financial market prices  and results from the Desk’s December  surveys suggest that 
investors  perceive  the likelihood  of near‐term changes to the target range for the 
federal funds  rate to have  declined over the  intermeeting  period.  Expectations  for 
the path of the federal funds  rate over the  next few years  fell modestly,  on net.  
Meanwhile,  survey‐based measures  of the longer‐run expected  federal funds  rate 
have fallen further. 
Figure 1 shows that the probability  distribution  for th
e level of  the federal funds  rate 
following  the December  FOMC meeting,  based on options quotes, narrowed  notably 
over the intermeeting  period.  A straight  read of the distribution  suggests  that 
investors  currently  attach about  90 
percent probability  to the target range being  left 
unchanged,  and about 10 percent  probability  to a 25‐ basis‐point reduction.   The 
corresponding  average probability  distribution  from the December  Desk surveys (not 
shown) also narrowed  notably and suggests  similarly high odds on no change in the 
target range  at the upcomi ng meeting.   
The option‐impli
ed distribution  for the level  of the federal funds rate following  the 
January meeting (not shown) also narrowed  and implies a probability  of about 75 
percent on the federal funds  rate remaining  in its current range.  However,  the 
corresponding  distribution  following  the March meeting,  shown in  figure 2, was 
relatively  little changed  over the interm eeting 
period.  The latter distribution  suggests  
that investors  currently  attach about  equal odds to the federal funds  rate falling into  
either the 1.25 to 1.50 percent range or the  1.50 to 1.75 percent range. 
Figure 3 shows  the option‐implied probabilities,  unadjusted  for term premiums,  of the 
effective federal funds  rate falling  in the current targ et range of 
1.50 percent to 1.75 
percent following  each of the FOMC meetings  between now  and September 2020.1  
As discussed  above, the probabilities  of the federal funds rate remaining  in the 
current target range following  the December  and January FOMC meetings  have risen 
notably, on net, from their levels prior to the  October  FOMC meeting and stand at 
relatively  high values.  However, the  probabilities  of the federal funds  rate remaining  
within its  current range following  subseq uent meetings  are 
relatively  little changed  
and are near or less than  1/3.  Similar to the  post‐March distribution  shown in  figure 2, 
the option‐implied distributions  for subsequent  meetings  (not shown) place much 
higher odds on the federal  funds rate being  below the current targe t range rather 
than 
above it.  
1 Each bar shows the probability  of no net change in the federal funds  target range between  
today and a different  future meeting.   For example,  the bars for December  2019 and March 2020 
correspond  with the modal outcomes  in figure 1 and figure 2, respectively.

Looking further ahead, figure  4 shows the probability  distribution  for the level of  the 
federal funds  rate at the end  of 2020, as reported  by the average respondent to the  
December  Desk surveys.   The average respondent places  the highest probability,  of 
about 35 percent,  on the federal funds rate falling  in the current  target range  of  1.50 
to 1.75 percent.   Of note,  respondents  assign a much higher  probability  to the federal 
funds rate falling  below the current target range (about 50 percent  odds) than above 
it (about 10 percent odds).   This is similar to the  market‐implied distributions  for the 
federal  funds rate, which assign increasingly  larger odds to  a lower target  range. 
The blue lines  in figure 5 show the expected  federal funds  rate path  implied by OIS 
quotes under the assumption  of zero term premiums.   Since the October FOMC  
meeting,  end‐2020, ‐ 2021, and ‐2022 forward rates  fell by 9, 7, and 2 basis points, 
respectively.  A straight  read of these market ‐implied forward rates suggests  that 
investors  expect the federal funds rate to fall about  30 basis points between now  and 
the end of 2020 
and to remain  little changed  over the  subsequent  few years.    
The median respondent  to the Desk’s December  surveys (the black crosses in figure 5)  
reported  no change in the targe
t range as  the most likely outcome  through end‐2022, 
although  the  mean expected  paths implied by the average respondent (the brown  
diamonds)  and the staff’s macro‐ finance model (the  green line) lie  close to the current 
unadjusted  forward rate  path.2  In contrast,  the latest path  from the staff term 
structure model  that adjusts OIS  forward rates for term premiums (the  purple lines) 
suggests that the federal funds  rate is expected  to rise gradually.   
Figure 6 shows measures  of the longer‐run expected  federal funds  rate.  A straight  
read of forward  rates implied by Treasury  yields  su ggests that investors’  current 
expectation for  the average federal funds  rate 5 to 10 years  ahead (the blue line) was 
about unchanged  over the  intermeeting  period, at 2.0 percent.   Adjustment  for term 
premiums using  various staff models (the light‐ red‐shaded region shows a range of 
four such model estimates)  suggests  that 5‐to‐ 10‐year‐ ahead expectations  remain 
above the unadjusted  forward rates,  
at between 2.4  and 2.9 percent.   The average  
longer‐run forecast  from the Blue Chip  survey (the yellow diamonds)  declined  further, 
with the most recent December  reading standing  at 2.4 percent,  about 0.7 percent 
point lower th an in December  2018.  
Meanwhile,  the average longer‐run CPI forecast 
from the December  Blue Chip  Survey (not shown) was little changed, suggesting  that 
longer‐run expectations  of the short‐term  real interest rate have  declined.   The 
median longer ‐run forecast  from the Desk’s December  surveys (the green diamonds)  
also declined  to about  2.4 percent, a to uch lower than  in 
the October surveys.   
2 The staff’s macro‐finance model is discussed  in the box “A Macro‐Finance Measure of Term 
Premiums  in Federal  Funds Futures Rates” in the Financial Markets section of the April 2019 
Tealbook  A.  The survey mean path is estimated  from respondents’  unconditional  probability 
distributions  for the year‐end federal funds rate.  The difference  between  the mean and modal 
expected  federal funds  rate fo
r end‐2020  reflects  the left‐skewed distribution  in figure 4.

 THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
At the past three FOMC meetings, po licymakers cited the implica tions of global 
developments for the U.S. economic outlook and muted inflation pressures as reasons for 
reducing the target range for the federal funds rate.  Economic activity has been 
expanding at a moderate pace, despite weak global growth and th e adverse effect of trade 
uncertainty on business fixed investment, exports, and manufacturing; the labor market remains strong; inflation, wh ile continuing to run below 2 perc ent, has stabilized; and the 
downside risks to the economi c outlook seem to have diminished somewhat.  
Policymakers may consequently asse ss that the recent adjustments to the target range are 
sufficient to support the Committee’s objectives.  In addition,  they may view the current 
stance of monetary policy as we ll-calibrated to cushion the eco nomy against adverse 
factors and risks and as like ly to remain appropriate as long a s incoming information 
about the economy remains broadly consistent with the current o utlook. 
Policymakers may see inflation rising to 2 percent over time an d discern no 
unwelcome upward pressure on price inflation.  They may note th at with the 
unemployment rate projected to hov er near 50-year lows, and aft er taking account of the 
lags in the effects of the accommodation provided over the cour se of the year, the current 
stance of policy is at a setting appropriate to support a susta ined return of inflation to 
2 percent. 
When considering the risks t o the outlook, policymakers may als o note that the 
likelihood of recession in the next 12 months reported from various recession-probability models has come down significan tly over this intermeeting period.  Also, policymakers 
may observe that the inversion i n the late summer of many porti ons of the yield curve, to 
which market commentary pointed a s recession signal, has now ce ased.  They may see 
these developments as reinforcing their view that the stance of  policy is currently 
appropriate—despite the asymmetric risks associated with the ef fective lower bound on 
the policy rate.  However, if developments emerge that lead to a material reassessment of 
the economic outlook, the Committee may wish to indicate that i t would respond 
accordingly.  In particular, with the resolution of the risks w eighing on certain sectors of 
the economy unclear, the Committee may also wish to indicate th at it will continue to 
monitor the implications of incom ing information for the econom ic outlook, explicitly 
referencing “global developmen ts and muted inflation pressures. ”

 If policymakers choose the polic y action given in Alternative B , financial market 
responses to this decision woul d likely be relatively modest.  Market prices, along with 
responses to the Desk’s latest surveys of primary dealers and market participants indicate 
that investors are nearly certai n that the target range for the  federal funds rate will be left 
unchanged at the December meeting.  
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Alternative A conveys a somew hat greater likelihood of an additional monetary 
policy easing in the future th an Alternative B.  Although Alter native A maintains the 
current target range for the fed eral funds rate,  it conveys mor e concern about the outlook 
for inflation.  In particular, it communicates a more downbeat interpretation of current 
measures of longer-term inflation expectations, and it highligh ts the fact that inflation 
continues to run below 2 percent and may remain below that level for longer than 
expected. 
Policymakers may be particularl y concerned about the ongoing we akness in 
inflation and inflation expecta tions, or view risks to the inflation outlook as significantly 
weighted to the downside.  If s o, they may deem it appropriate to state that “Indicators of 
longer-term inflation exp ectations remain low.” 
With inflation continuing to run pe rsistently below the Committ ee’s symmetric 
2 percent objective, several sur vey-based measures of inflation  expectations at or near the 
lower end of their historical ra nges, and market-based measures of inflation 
compensation near multi-year lows, policymakers may be concerne d that inflation 
expectations have already moved below levels consistent with th e Committee’s 2 percent 
objective.  They may therefore see significant risks that infla tion could fail to return to 
2 percent on a sustained basis a nd so favor Alternative A, whic h states concern about 
“whether inflation will remain below 2 percent longer than expe cted.” 
Policymakers might also argue tha t inflation running modestly a bove 2 percent 
for a time is needed to re-cen ter inflation expectations on the  2 percent objective.  They 
may see accomplishing this re-centering before the next recessi on as particularly 
important:  Anchoring inflation e xpectations more solidly at 2 percent would better 
enable monetary policy to provide  accommodation in a future dow nturn.  Policymakers 
may see the reason for this as  twofold.  First, keeping long-ru n inflation expectations at 2 
percent would help prevent an ina dvertent increase in the real interest rate that would

 otherwise occur if inflation exp ectations were to fall.  Second , well anchored inflation 
expectations help keep nominal int erest rates further away from  the lower bound, thus 
preserving scope for the Committee to ease policy.  
A statement such as Alternativ e A would likely be seen by marke t participants as 
implying a more accommodative path for the policy rate than had  been anticipated.  If 
market participants interpret Alt ernative A as expressing the C ommittee’s desire to 
provide additional accommodation s o as to raise inflation to 2 percent or above, then 
equity prices and inflation com pensation would likely rise.  However, if market 
participants predominantly interpreted Alternative A as amounti ng to a bleaker reading of 
the outlook for the economy than they had been expecting, equit y prices would likely fall. 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C  
Alternative C illustrates the approach the Committee could cons ider in 
circumstances in which the economy continues to perform well an d the case for some 
reduction in the degree of monetary accommodation has materiall y strengthened.  
Alternative C thus signals that a rate hike is imminent.   
Policymakers may note that many longer-term estimates of the re al federal funds 
rate from time-series models and s urveys currently range betwee n 0.3 and 1.3 percent.2  
With real GDP growth continuing to run at or a bit above its po tential rate, the labor 
market remaining strong, and infla tion expected to rise to 2 percent, policymakers may 
wish to return policy to a mor e neutral stance over time. 
Policymakers may judge that downside risks to the outlook are d iminishing.  The 
risk of a “no-deal” Brexit has declined considerably.  While th e news regarding trade 
negotiations has been mixed, on ne t, over the intermeeting period, discussions continued 
between the United States and Chi na on a trade agreement and a near-term deal could 
reduce the associated trade un certainty.  Accordingly, to the e xtent that policymakers 
view the recent reduc tions in the target range for the federal funds rate as insuring against 
downside risks, a relatively m ore balanced outlook could sugges t that some removal of 
accommodation may soon be appropriate.  In addition, with the o utlook for economic 
activity on a somewhat firmer footing, policymakers may judge t hat the risk of inflation 
remaining well below the 2 percen t objective is not particularl y high.  They may see this

 judgment as supported by the fact that the Federal Reserve Bank  of Dallas’ trimmed 
mean PCE measure of inflation ha s remained at 2 percent in rece nt months, and by 
readings on inflation expectations, which a re little changed. 
In addition, policymakers may reg ard persistently low interest rates as 
endangering continued financial  stability.  For example, they m ay stress that prices in 
equity and bond markets are near  historical peaks, while valuation pressures in leveraged 
loan and commercial real estate markets remain high.  As a result, they may judge that 
financial-stability considerations strengthen the case for remo ving over time the recently-
added accommodation. 
If policymakers see a growing likelihood of a reduction in the degree of policy 
accommodation, the characterization of the incoming economic da ta in paragraph 1 
would presumably be an important  means by which to signal that the economic outlook 
has changed.  Furthermore, in such circumstances they may also assess that it is 
appropriate to signal that a “ reduction in the degree of monetary accommodation may 
soon become appropriate.”  The Committee may judge that this ki nd of guidance is 
associated with a reduced ris k of generating a policy surprise,  while preserving 
optionality with regard to future rate hikes.

Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation  
The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy 
stance announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its st atement on October 30, 
2019 December 11, 2019 : 
 The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted [ unanimously ] to 
lower maintain  the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances  to at 
1.55 percent, effective October 31, 2019 December 12, 2019 .  
 As part of its policy decision, the F ederal Open Market Committee voted to 
authorize and direct the Open Mar ket Desk at the Federal Reserv e Bank of New 
York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in th e System Open Market 
Account in accordance with the f ollowing domestic policy direct ive: 
“Effective October 31, 2019 December 12, 2019 , the Federal Open Market 
Committee directs the Desk to unde rtake open market operations as necessary to 
maintain the federal funds rat e in a target range of 1-1/2 to  1-3/4 percent.  In light 
of recent and expected increases in the Federal Reserve’s non-r eserve liabilities, 
the Committee directs the Desk to purchase continue purchasing  Treasury bills 
at least into the sec ond quarter of next year 2020 to maintain over time ample 
reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early September 2019.  
The Committee also directs the Desk to conduct continue conducting  term and 
overnight repurchase agreement  operations at least through Janu ary of next year 
2020 to ensure that the supply of res erves remains ample even durin g periods of 
sharp increases in non-reserve liabilities, and to mitigate the  risk of money market 
pressures that could adversel y affect policy implementation.  I n addition, the 
Committee directs the Desk to c onduct overnight reverse repurch ase operations 
(and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than  one day when 
necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at 
an offering rate of 1.45 percen t, in amounts limited only by th e value of Treasury 
securities held outright in the Sys tem Open Market Account that are available for 
such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day.  
 
The Committee directs the Des k to continue rolli ng over at auct ion all principal 
payments from the Federal Rese rve’s holdings of Treasury securi ties and to 
continue reinvesting all principal payments from the Federal Re serve’s holdings 
of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities received d uring each 
calendar month.  Principal paymen ts from agency debt and agency  mortgage-
backed securities up to $20 billion per month will continue to be reinvested in 
Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition o f Treasury 
securities outstandi ng; principal payments in excess of $20 bil lion per month will 
continue to be reinvested in agency mortgage-backed securities.   Small deviations 
from these amounts for operati onal reasons are acceptable.

 The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll an d coupon swap 
transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Feder al Reserve's agency 
mortgage-backed securities transactions.”  
 
 In a related action, the Board of  Governors of the Federal Rese rve System voted 
[ unanimously ] to approve a 1/4 percentage point d ecrease in the establishment of 
the primary credit rate to at the existing level of  2.25 percent, effective October 31, 
2019.  In taking this action, the Board approved requests to es tablish that rate 
submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Minneapolis 
and San Francisco.

Market Committee or the Boar d of Governors regarding details of  the Federal Reserve's

Balance Sheet and Income Projections 
The staff has prepared projecti ons of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the 
associated income statement that  are consistent with the projections in Tealbook A.  In 
comparison to the October Tealbook,  the federal funds rate projection is revised down in 
the near term, while projections  of longer-term interest rates are about unchanged. 
Reserve balances.   The path for reserves is lar gely unchanged relative to the 
October Tealbook.  As of November  2019, the level of reserve ba lances stood at 
$1.55 trillion.  Through mid-April  2020, purchases of Treasury bills and repo operations 
are assumed to keep reserves at or above $1.46 trillion, the av erage level that prevailed in 
early September (see the upper chart in the exhib it titled “SOMA Open Market 
Operations and Their Near-Term Effect on Reserve Balances”).1  From May 2020 
onward, reserves are projected t o grow in line with nominal GDP.2 
Evolution of the SOMA portfolio.  As of November 2019, about $3.7 trillion of 
securities are held in the SO MA portfolio, consisting of about $2.2 trillion of Treasury 
securities and $1.4 tri llion of agency securities (see the exhi bit titled “Federal Reserve 
Balance Sheet Month-end Projections—December Tealbook”).3  Consistent with the 
Committee’s October 2019 Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Im plementation, we 
assume that the Desk will cont inue to purchase Treasury bills a t a pace of $60 billion per 
month until mid-April.4  Thereafter, we assume that the SOMA portfolio continues to 
expand in order to accommodate tre nd increases in reserves and in other Federal Reserve 
1 Although a minimum level of $1 .46 trillion of reserve balances  is likely to ensure that they 
remain ample through mid-April 2 020, the minimum level of reser ves consistent with remaining in an 
ample-reserves regime is uncer tain and will be reassessed as in formation accrues about banks’ demand for 
reserve balances.  These issues were discussed in the March 201 9 FOMC memo, “Transitioning to an 
Ample Reserves Regime with Lower Reserves.” 
2 We assume that liability items o ther than currency, reserves, and the TGA, such as the foreign 
repo pool and DFMU balances, grow in line with nominal GDP from  the start of the projection period.  The 
projection incorporates the sta ff’s near-term forecast for cont inued repo operations through January 2020, 
and incorporates the staff’s nea r-term forecast for TGA balance s through April 2020. Thereafter, TGA 
balances are assumed to grow in line with nominal GDP. 
3 SOMA securities held outright i nclude bills purch ased for rese rve management, but do not 
include securities held temporarily through the Desk’s overnigh t repo operations. 
4 Median expectations from the De sk’s December surveys were for bill purchases to continue at a 
pace of $60 billion per month thro ugh March, and then step down over the following three months to $20 
billion in June.

 liabilities at a pace that is roughly in line with nominal GDP growth (see the exhibit titled 
“Total Assets and Selecte d Balance Sheet Items”).5  As a result of these assumptions, and 
as in the previous Tealbook, the s ize of the balance sheet as a  share of nominal GDP 
remains near its current lev el of 19 percent through the projec tion horizon. 
 The weighted-average duration of  the SOMA Treasury portfolio is  currently about 
6.5 years.  As shown in the exhibit “Projections for the Characteristics of SOMA 
Treasury Securities Holdings,” t he path for duration is similar  to that in the October 
projection.  Duration is project ed to decline to about 6 years by March 2020 as the share 
of bills increases to 14 percent  of the SOMA Treasury portfolio .  The decline in duration 
then decelerates, reflecting the slower pace of bill purchases.6  All told, the SOMA 
Treasury portfolio attains its assumed longer-run composition, consisting of one-third 
Treasury bills, in 2025:Q3, the same as in the October Tealbook. 
Principal payments from holdings  of agency securities are proje cted to exceed the 
$20 billion cap on reinvestment into  Treasury securities throug h the middle of 2020, and 
fall just under $20 billion in each month for the remainder of the year (see the table and 
lower charts in the exhibit titl ed “SOMA Open Market Operations  and Their Near-Term 
Effect on Reserve Balances”).  Acco rdingly, reinvestments of agency MBS into MBS are 
expected to continue through mid-2020.  The share of agency MBS in the SOMA 
portfolio, which currently stands  at 39 percent, is expected to decline to about 11 percent 
by the end of 2025.  In comparison t o the October Tealbook, age ncy MBS holdings are 
expected to decline at a faster rate after 2021 (see the exhibi t titled “Total Assets and 
Selected Balance Sheet Items”), reflecting higher forecasted pr epayments.7  
                                                 
5 We assume that rollovers of ma turing Treasury securities will continue to be directed to newly 
issued securities at Treasury auctions in proportion to the mat urity distribution of Treasury debt issued at 
the time of rollover. 
6 We continue to assume that purchases aimed at accommodating tr end growth in Federal Reserve 
liabilities will be directed entirely towards Treasury bills un til bills constitute approximately one-third of 
the Federal Reserve’s portfolio  of Treasury securities, close to the pre-crisis com position.  Once that 
composition is reached, further purchases aimed at accommodatin g growth in Federal Reserve liabilities 
are assumed to reflect the proj ected maturity distribution of Treasury securities outstanding at that time. 
7 The higher forecasted prepayments are the result of switching in this Tealbook to a new model 
for forecasting prepay ments.  The new model includes additional  explanatory variables and an improved 
specification to better account for some of the drivers of prep ayment activity such as seasonality and 
refinancing incentives over time.  It is also estimated over a longer sample period with CUSIP-level data to 
better characterize recent change s in mortgage markets and long er-term trends in housing markets.  The 
new model reduces out-of-sample  forecast errors, as the previou s model tended to underestimate 
prepayment activity.

 Correspondingly, the path for SOM A Treasury holdings has been r evised upwards as 
these additional principal paymen ts from MBS holdings are reinv ested into Treasury 
securities.8 
 Unrealized gains or losses. In comparison to the October Tealbook, the path for 
the unrealized position of the S OMA portfolio is largely unchanged (see the two bottom 
charts in the exhibit titled “Income Projections”).  The SOMA p ortfolio was in a net 
unrealized gain position of a bout $195 billion at the end of Oc tober.  With longer-term 
interest rates projected to ri se, the unrealized gain position is expected to decline over the 
next few years before turning int o an unrealized loss position by 2022:Q4.  The position 
bottoms out at an unrealized loss of around $40 billion in 2025 :Q4.9   
Total Term Premium Effect.  As shown in the table “Proj ections for the 10-Year 
Treasury Total Term Premium Eff ect (TTPE),” the securities held  in the SOMA portfolio 
are estimated to be reducing the  term premium embedded in the 1 0-year Treasury yield 
by 136 basis points in the current quarter, about the same as i n the October Tealbook.10  
Over the projection horizon, the m agnitude of the downward pres sure exerted on the term 
premium in longer-term Treasury y ields is estimated to diminish  gradually, at an average 
pace of about 2.5 basis points per  year.  The gradual decline r eflects the decrease in the 
duration of the Federal Reserve’s  securities holdings over the projection horizon.  At the 
end of 2030, the total term premium effect of the SOMA portfoli o on the 10-year 
Treasury yield is estimated t o be about 110 basis points.  Over the projection horizon, the 
SOMA portfolio is expected to e xert slightly less downward pressure on Treasury term 
premiums than was proj ected in October.   
  Remittances.  Remittances to the Treasury are projected to decline to $54 bil lion 
this year from $65 billion in 2018 (see the middle left chart i n the exhibit titled “Income 
Projections”).  This reduction mai nly reflects lower interest i ncome resulting from the 
reduction in SOMA securities holdings through September 2019.  Total interest expense 
                                                 
8 We assume that reinvestments of principal payments from agency  securities holdings into 
Treasury securities continue to be spread across the maturity spectrum of outstanding Treasury securities 
for the entire projection period. 
9 See the Tealbook B box titled “W hat Does It Mean for the SOMA Portfolio to be in an 
‘Unrealized Loss’ Position?” (Jun e 2018) for an explanation of the accounting concepts underlying 
unrealized and realized gain an d loss positions, as well as the ir implications for the Federal Reserve’s 
ability to meet its obligations.   
10 The overall 10-year Treasury term  premium is assumed to gradua lly approach its long-run value 
of 50 basis points.

 is projected to be $41 billion this year, slightly lower than i n 2018.11  Remittances are 
expected to increase to $65 bill ion next year, and remain rough ly flat through 2022. 
Remittances are then expected to increase for the rest of the p rojection period, reflecting 
higher net interest income asso ciated with a growing balance sh eet, as yields on longer-
term securities in the SOMA portfolio exceed the rate paid on r eserve balances.  In 
comparison with the October Teal book, the projected path for remittances is slightly 
higher through 2020, largely reflecting the r evised path for interest expense tied to the 
downward revision in the federal f unds rate path.  Thereafter, the path for remittances is 
projected to be slightly lower than in the previous Tealbook. 
 
                                                 
11 We continue to assume that the FOMC will set a 25  basis point-wide target range for the federal 
funds rate throughout the projection period.  Consistent with t he FOMC’s September 2019 Implementation 
Note, we assume that the IOER rate will be set 20 basis points below the top of the target range, and the 
offering rate on overnight RRPs will be set 5 basis points belo w the bottom of the range for the rest of the 
projection period.
